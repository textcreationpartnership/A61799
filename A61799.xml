            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Treatiſe was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Latin,</hi> by an Eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Divinity at the time when the Diviſions of thoſe who were fallen off from the <hi>Catholic Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> ſeemed to ſeparate them from one another, at as great a Diſtance as they were from her who had been their common Parent. It was immediately Tranſlated into ſeveral Languages; as <hi>French, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and met with a very conſiderable Succeſs, in theſe four great Diſtricts of the <hi>Anti-Catholic</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44335:3"/>Party, <hi>viz. Germany, Holland, France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Edition that was in our Language, being by length of time ſpent and gone, and thoſe few which may be left, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat out of Faſhion, and ſo leſs agreeable to this preſent Age, it hath been thought worth the pains to Tranſlate it a new, and to Publiſh it as it is here; ſuppoſing it may be no leſs proper and uſeful now, when the Diviſions of the foreſaid four great Parties, are much more Dilated and Multiplied then they were then; and the Minds of Men far more unſettled, and buſie in ſeeking where to fix, as to that Great Concern of Mankind, the true Religion.</p>
            <p>Indeed ſince the greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are Born and Bred up in Darkneſs, and in the Shadow of Death, it ſhould ſeem that the Divine Goodneſs could not have found out or beſtowed a more ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or more neceſſary Bleſſing upon them, then in providing a means whereby they
<pb facs="tcp:44335:3"/>might be drawn out of ſuch a miſerable ſtate, by enlightning their minds with the Knowledge of this true Religion.</p>
            <p>But, it has pleaſed the ſame Divine Goodneſs, to temper ſo great a Mercy with an inſcrutable mixture of Juſtice, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, that this true Religion ſhould not be ſo Viſible and Evident to all Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, but that there is ſtill great Danger of Miſtaking and Miſcarrying in the Search.</p>
            <p>This cannot but Cauſe great unquietneſs to all ſerious Enquirers within themſelves, and no leſs Trouble and Conteſt among the ſeveral Pretenders to it in the World; and hereby, that which was deſigned by Almighty God, to be the greatſt Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mens Minds in this Life, and the only Ground of Hope for the Life to come, is become the occaſion of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſturbances in the one, and of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Miſeries in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44335:4"/>Nevertheleſs (to the Glory of God's Grace be it ſpoken, and to the Honour of the True Religion) theſe difficulties and obſcurities are not ſo many nor ſo great, but that they may be pierced and broken through by the truly <hi>Humble, Serious</hi> and <hi>Sincere</hi> Enquirer.</p>
            <p>They are indeed impenetrable, and an occaſion of ſtumbling to the Paſſionate, and to the <hi>Prejudic'd,</hi> to the <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Self-Conceited.</hi> But this is not the fault of Religion, nor of the means provided, but of ſuch Perſons; and it is no more then what happens every day in things, of which there is no diſpute; and where the Truth and the Right are Diſcernable and Unqueſtionable at firſt Sight. For if the Mind of Man be taken up before-hand with any of theſe Preventions, no Light or Evidence of any Truth, though never ſo certain, can make way for its Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we ſee in the great and known Sins which habitually reign in ſome Men, in ſpite of all Conviction, and in the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Preferences of Temporals before
<pb facs="tcp:44335:4"/>Eternals, even amongſt thoſe who are more Docile and Obedient.</p>
            <p>Such then being the Weakneſs and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Mans Heart, that the leaſt adheſion to any one Object, renders it looſe and indifferent to all others the while; it ſhould ſeem, that thoſe, whoſe Office and Profeſſion it is, to reduce ſuch as are in Error, to the Knowledge and Love of Truth, ſhould not labour ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> much, or ſo ſoon to Convince their <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,</hi> as to Diſpoſe their <hi>Wills,</hi> or at leaſt to endeavour the Preparation of the one, Proportionably to the Cultivation of the other. Since to do otherwiſe, is but to ſow good Seed in Thorny or Stony Ground, contrary to the Rules and Practice of Natural and Spiritual Husbandry.</p>
            <p>But, what means will you ſay, can be propoſed Sufficient and Efficacious enough to work ſuch Diſpoſitions in Men ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely affected?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44335:5"/>Why truly, ſince it is not Naturally in the Power of one Man to gain admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the Will of another, but by the way of the Underſtanding; as alſo there is no means of attacking the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but by the imagination, and by the Senſes: It muſt be acknowledged, that it is eaſier to diſcover then to remove theſe grand Impediments of finding out or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Truth. For all the ways and paſſages whereby the Truth ſhould enter, are ſtop'd and fill'd up with Notions and Fancies, which though vain and weak in themſelves, yet by their near approach and fair appearance, keep Truth and right Reaſon at ſuch a diſtance, that all their Efforts fall ſhort, and do no Execution.</p>
            <p>However, ſome preliminary Labour and Induſtry methinks might be uſed to remove ſuch Rubbiſh, and to clear the Paſſages from thoſe Obſtructions which foreſtal the Truth. And in the firſt place, it will not be hard to Convince even ſuch Perſons, that all ſuch <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Prejudices</hi> are
<pb facs="tcp:44335:5"/>at leaſt in themſelves mean and unworthy: For the contrary Virtues are acknowledged and approved by all, even by thoſe who have the leaſt ſhare of them. Secondly, it is not hard to Convince the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that they and all Men are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very prone and ſubject to ſuch Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and that therefore they ought to be jealous, and even inquiſitive, whether they be not actually prevented by them. Thirdly, They are thus far agreed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with the Truth, that ſuch Paſſions are its Enemies; and that there is no holding Intelligence with it and them at the ſame time; that they are the Cauſes and Promoters of all Error, as they are alſo Fed and Cheriſhed themſelves by Error. And Laſtly, that whoſoever fails or falls ſhort of attaining to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, by the Fault of theſe Paſſions, they will be ſo far from excuſing, that they will be the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Sin and Miſery.</p>
            <p>In the next place, it may not be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to repreſent that the Vertues and
<pb facs="tcp:44335:6"/>Diſpoſitions contrary to theſe Paſſions are ſo indiſpenſable that never any one at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Truth without them. It is the firſt Leſſon in the School of Chriſt, to ſeek and receive the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as a little Child that is with a Meek, Docile, Humble, Willing Mind. To ſeek it in the firſt place, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing neceſſary, and to be willing to part with all things for it. The Truth can no more fail to enter into a Soul thus diſpoſed, then the Sun to reflect it ſelf in a well Poliſh'd and Spotleſs Glaſs.</p>
            <p>And ſuch Diſpoſitions as theſe are in themſelves, and even to Natural common Senſe do appear ſo equitable, that they are required in Diſciples of all Arts and Sciences, how much more then are they to be demanded in all Perſuits of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Supernatural Knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Teachers and Profeſſors of which ſeem to have a Right to exact them of all, who pretend to be their Diſciples;
<pb facs="tcp:44335:6"/>and they may and ought to proteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand againſt all Paſſionate, Prejudiced, Self-intereſſed, Self-conceited, Arrogant, Preſumptuous, Unſerious and Inſincere Diſcourſers.</p>
            <p>To ſuch, Books Written by Angels and Sermons Preach'd by God himſelf, would prove unfruitful; as was the Caſe of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> even for theſe very Reaſons; whilſt of the Poor and Simple, of the Meek and Lowly, a few words of an unlearned Fiſherman could Convert Thouſands.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, if theſe Diſpoſitions are ſo neceſſary in all other Inqueſts, they are much more ſo in the peruſers of the following Treatiſe. Which being a Conſult, does in a moſt particular manner, require an Impartial, Unbiaſt and Unprejudiced Reader; for as much as he is invited hither, not ſo much as a Party, as a Judge, in whom a contrary Diſpoſition is intolerable. Let him therefore conſider, that he is to ſit and hold the Ballance
<pb facs="tcp:44335:7"/>in the Scales of which are to be put and weighed the oppoſite Practices of Two contrary Parties, great and zealous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to, and Aſſertors of the True, that is (as each thinks) of their own Reſpective Religion.</p>
            <p>Nothing will be offered to his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion, but unqueſtionable Matters of Fact, of which the common Senſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind may be judge, all begun and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted within theſe Hundred and Fifty Years: The Effects and Conſequences of which do infinitely Touch and Concern him. And therefore, though he be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to hold indifference in the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet let him have a care he do not ſo in the Deciſion; for it is of terrible importance to him, either not to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine at all, or to determine wrong. For when all is done, he muſt unavoidably in the end become a Party, who, here in the beginning is made a Judge, and the Sentence which he ſhall, or ſhall not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce (it matters not which) if it be not the right, will fall heavy only upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44335:7"/>Let him therefore Read and attend with Fear; and to all the Preparations recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended before in this <hi>Preface,</hi> let him add this one more of Earneſt and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer, that God the Enlightner of all Minds, and the Mover of all Hearts, will pleaſe to Viſit his with the Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Grace of Faith and Charity, that he may ſee and choſe, and for ever Embrace and Adhere to the only means for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Life, <hi>The True Religion,</hi> Amen.</p>

            <head>What Faith and Religion, is beſt to be imbrac'd.</head>
            <p>NEver was there greater Variety of Religions, than in theſe our days, and never more diſpute about the True one. Many waver up and down therein, all their Lives long, and never come to fix upon any; but ſhift their Religion, as Men do their Lodgings, to try where their Minds may be moſt at eaſe. Others, without any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, blindly venture upon the firſt that comes in their way; and if you ask them, why this, rather than any of the reſt, all they can ſay for themſelves, is, they take this for the beſt; or perhaps (which yet every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends in behalf of his own) becauſe it is moſt conformable to the <hi>Pure Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet ſuch a choice as this, requires the greateſt ſearch and deliberation imaginable, as upon which our eternal Salvation depends. Surely Eternal Salvation and Damnation are Matters of no ſmall Moment, in compariſon with which all other things (good or bad) are as nothing. Now theſe depend upon the Goodneſs of your Religion. If your Religion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44335:9"/>be good, 'twill be eaſie (by the Grace of God) to obtain Salvation; but if bad, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be ſaved. For, by a bad or falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>you cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Heb 11. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently you can never obtain pardon of your Sins, nor true Juſtice, nor by any Means be made partaker of Chriſt's Redemption. And ſo you ſtill remain in Death, and the Wrath of God abideth on you. For all Mankind, without ſuch Redemption and New Life in Chriſt, do remain in the Death of Sin, and are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath; but whoſoever has not the true Religion, has no ſhare in ſuch Redemption, and therefore muſt neceſſarily abide in Death, be a Child of Wrath, and become Fewel for Hell-fire.</p>
            <p>Now this true Religion is but one, and cannot be many fold. For there is but one Truth, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God, and one Lord of all, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; Firſt, That all Religions, all Beliefs, and Confeſſions of Faith, beſides one, are falſe, noxious, peſtiferous, and introduc'd by the Devil (the firſt Author of them) who is the Father of Lies. And Secondly, That none who does not profeſs this Religion, can ever obtain Salvation, and all that are without it (though they live otherwiſe never ſo laudably) will periſh everlaſtingly. For that which the Apoſtle ſays of Charity <hi>(If I could ſpeak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, if I ſhould know all Myſteries, and ſhould diſtribute all my goods to the Poor, and deliver my Body to be burnt, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44335:9"/>want Charity, it would nothing profit me)</hi> may with greater Reaſon be ſaid of the true Faith and Religion, which is the Foundation of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and all other Chriſtian Vertues. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It follows, that it is a groſs and ſtupid Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of ſome of the Vulgar, who eſteem it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Salvation, if you only believe in Chriſt, and that he dyed for your Sins; altho' as to many other Points of Faith (pertaining to the Sacraments and Sacrifice of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) you believe nothing. For after this rate, almoſt all ſort of Hereticks ſhould be ſaved. For all of them believe in Chriſt (otherwiſe they were not Hereticks, but Apoſtates) and believe (ſome few excepted) that he dyed for our Sins. Then alſo the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> and <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Donatiſts, Sabellians, Arrians, Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Eutychians, Monotholites,</hi> and the like Peſts of the Church ſhall be ſaved. Why then hath the Church, in all Ages, ſo vehemently oppos'd her ſelf againſt Hereſies? Why does St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle command us to avoid the Man that is an Heretick, after the 1ſt or 2d Admonition? <hi>Tit</hi> 2. Why does he bid us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of their Speech, which eateth as a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. In vain all theſe things are ſaid and done, if Hereticks may be ſaved. I am ſure this Fancy is againſt the Conſent of all Ages. <hi>Let us ſuppoſe</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) <hi>a Man to be chaſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>4.</hi> contr. Donat. c. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>continent, not covetous, nor idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous; but bountiful and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Poor; an Enemy to none, not contentious,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44335:10"/>patient, quiet, envying none, ſober, frugal, but yet a Heretick; ſuch a one, without all doubt</hi> (meerly becauſe he is an Heretick) <hi>ſhall never enjoy the Kingdom of God.</hi> For (as St. <hi>James</hi> witneſſeth) he that hath offended in one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, is made guilty of all, <hi>James</hi> 2. and Ioſeth all Juſtice, though he keeps the reſt; becauſe he contemns the Law-maker himſelf, who made the whole Law: So he that obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately denies one Point of Faith, although he believe the reſt, is guilty of diſ-believing all, and loſes his whole Faith and Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he deſpiſeth the Author of it. For it is one and the ſame firſt and ſupreme Verity, which hath revealed all Points of Faith, and propoſed them to our Belief by the Church, his Spouſe, the Pillar and Ground of Truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. He therefore that ſhall obſtinately reject one Article of Faith, and will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the Teſtimony of the Church, is thereby judged to diſ-eſteem the Authority of God, (the ſupreme Verity) of whom the Church is the Publiſher, Interpreter, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
            <p>Neither matters it, that there are ſome principal Points of Faith, which he thinks he believes; becauſe he does not believe them with Divine Faith, which relies only upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, that is infallible; otherwiſe he would believe the reſt propoſed to him, in the ſame manner; but he believes them with a kind of Humane Faith; that is to ſay, becauſe by his <hi>private Judgment</hi> he is induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44335:10"/>them, taking upon himſelf the Authority of judging and diſcerning what things are to be believed, and what denied and rejected. Therefore the chief reaſon or motive of his Belief is private Judgment; and for that Cauſe all his Faith is humane and unprofitable.</p>
            <p>It is therefore moſt certain, that as true Juſtice extends it felf to the performance of all the Commandments, ſo the true Faith (which is requiſite to Salvation) extends it ſelf to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of all thoſe things which God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſo that we muſt believe them all, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, or be ready to believe them, if they be propounded to us the right way.</p>
            <p>Hereby is manifeſt, what great Care is to be taken, that we chuſe and profeſs the true Faith and Religion; ſince it is the Foundation of our Salvation, and that without it, we ſhall certainly be damn'd. Whereupon I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to propound ſome Conſiderations (obvious and manifeſt to all rational People) whereby they may take a right courſe in their Choice of the true Religion.</p>
            <div n="1" type="consideration">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44335:11"/>
               <head>The firſt Conſideration drawn from the tending to Perfection, which Chriſtian Religion excites us to.</head>
               <p>THat Religion is to be preferred, which conduces moſt to Purity and Holineſs of Life, which draws our Minds from all affection to earthly Things, and raiſes them to the love of heavenly. For this is the chief end of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to alienate the Minds of Men from Things temporal here below, and to elevate them towards the thinking, loving, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing of ſuch as are celeſtial and eternal.<note place="margin">Only the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on teaches per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Life.</note> Now ſuch is only the Catholick Religion. For this perſuades to abſtain from the Pleaſures of the Fleſh, and Snares of this Life. This alone teaches to contemn Riches and Honours, and to renounce them (when poſſeſſed) for Chriſt's ſake. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to Faſtings, Hair-cloth, and other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the Body, whereby the Fleſh is brought under Subjection, and ſubdued to the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Hence are there ſuch great numbers of Men and Women in the Catholick Church, who contemning Riches, Honours and Pleaſures (which they either enjoyed, or might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed) have bid adieu to the World; and mortifying their Fleſh, have wholly devoted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44335:11"/>themſelves to the Service of God, and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of Divine Things. Amongſt theſe are many Noble Men, and their Sons and Daughters; many of the rich Gentry, and their Children, many great Wits, many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their Eloquence, and knowledge in all kind of Literature; which is an evident ſign of the Divine Spirit, and true Religion. For that Religion cannot chuſe but be Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which withdraws Man's Nature (fixed on Earthly Things) and raiſes it up to Heavenly; which expels the Love of that which is Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and inſtils an affection to that which is Everlaſting; and in a word, which can work ſuch wonderful Changes in Men. <hi>The Tree is known by its Fruits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other Religions, eſpecially the <hi>Lutheran, Calviniſt,</hi> and <hi>Fanatick</hi> (For of theſe only I intend to treat in this Diſcourſe) do no ſuch thing. For they are ſo far from teaching Mortification of the Fleſh,<note place="margin">Other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons take away the ſtudy of Perfection and of all good Works.</note> Contempt of Earthly Things, and cutting off carnal Pleaſures, that they call Faſting the Tradition of Men, whereby God is worſhipped in vain; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from Fleſh with them, is Superſtition; Monaſtick Vows, they ſay, are impious, vain, and not at all to be obſerv'd; that Chaſtity is impoſſible; that all Men are bound to marry, and lye with a Woman, which <hi>Luther</hi> affirms to be as neceſſary, as Meat, Drink,<note place="margin">L. de Vit. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jug.</note> and Sleep, By which Doctrine it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44335:12"/>is come to paſs, that none of thoſe who are of theſe New Religions, do either mortifie their Fleſh by Faſting, or abide continent, or abſtain from Conjugal and Carnal Pleaſures, or abandon their Riches, and imbrace Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the Love of Chriſt; but all of them are for a ſenſual, eaſie, and Worldly Life, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Inclination of the Fleſh, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature. None of them have ſo much as a Notion of what it is to lead an Angelical Life upon Earth, as many of the Saints have done, and many ſtill do in the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>None of them can bring themſelves to caſt off the Cares and Solicitudes of this Life, and break the Bonds of the World, that, with more Freedom, they may follow Chriſt, and imitate his moſt holy Life, in this Mortal Fleſh. For, whatſoever is above the common and vulgar way of living, theſe New Religions diſ-allow. Who then does not ſee, that none of them is the Religion of Chriſt? For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt does not oblige us by <hi>Precept</hi> to Poverty, Chaſtity, ſingle Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he <hi>exhorts</hi> and <hi>counſels</hi> us to practice them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing great Rewards to thoſe that ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, and has ſhewn us how to do it by his own <hi>Example.</hi> And by this Counſel and Invitation of Chriſt, innumerable Perſons of all Degrees, Age; Sex, Nation, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, have attained to the higheſt pitch of Sanctity attainable in this Life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by became admirable to the whole World.</p>
               <p>But theſe New Religions plainly reject ſuch
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44335:12"/>purſuits of Perfection, as things impoſſible or ſuperſtitious. Nor do they diſcourage this eminent Sanctity alone; but likewiſe all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, even of good Works. For they teach,<note n="*" place="margin">Luth. art. <hi>31.</hi> &amp; <hi>36.</hi> &amp; lib. de liber. Chriſtiana.

                  </note> That a Man ſins in all his Works, although God does not impute this as Sin to Believers. Again, That Man, by all his good Works, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits nothing of God, nor is he made more gracious to him, nor become more juſt, nor ſhall obtain a greater Reward, whether he does many or few good Works, or none at all; but for his Faith alone, God eſteems and crowns him.</p>
               <p>If this Doctrine be true, who would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf about good Works, or give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Prayer, to Alms-giving, to Faſting, to help his Neighbour in neceſſity? For if there be ſin in all theſe Works, no Merit, nor Reward, or any thing of Advantage thereby, what ſhould move me to do them? Who will beſtow his Labour and Wealth in vain, and forſake the Temporal Commodities of this Life, to no purpoſe? Theſe new Religions therefore cut off all good Works, leaving only Faith to Men, as all in all, to attain Salvation. Truly, it ſeems not credible, that our Lord (by ſo much Labour and Pains, by ſo many Heavenly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, by his Sacred Blood, Croſs, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44335:13"/>Death) would be the Founder of ſuch a <hi>barren</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>Mean while, by thus attributing the merit of Eternal Life to our good Works,<note place="margin">An Objection refuted.</note> we do not obſcure the merits of Chriſt, as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries object; but rather illuſtrate and exalt them. For the Church hath decreed (as an Article of Faith) that Chriſt's Merits are ſo efficacious and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,<note place="margin">Trid. Seſs. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> that he has not only by them merited for us Everlaſting Life; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that ſtrength and power, by which we alſo merit.<note place="margin">The efficiency of Chriſt's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> As he does not diminiſh God's Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, but magnifies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols it, who ſays, that it not only operates and produces all things, but confers alſo upon Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the power of operating and producing the like. For there is nothing more declares the excellency and perfection of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> than that it is not only able to operate it <hi>ſelf,</hi> but can give ſtrength and ability to <hi>others</hi> to operate. Therefore, when we ſay, that Chriſt not only merited for us Eternal Life, but alſo confers a power to merit it, we far more extol the efficacy of Chriſt's Merits, than they who teach, he only merited all, and gave no power to us, to co-operate with his Merits. They therefore rather are injurious to Chriſt, who take from him this virtue, and efficacy of his Merits. As ſome Philoſophers, who teach, that no Creatures have power to operate, in-grafted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44335:13"/>in them, but only the uncreated Power of God doth all things, do derogate from God's Omnipotency, as if it were not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on them a power to operate and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with God. He indeed would be injurious to Chriſt, that ſhould aſcribe to Man any vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of meriting, <hi>not received</hi> from the Merits of Chriſt; as it would be an injury to God, to alledge, that Creatures have power to operate, not derived from God's Omnipotency. In a word, as the Operations of Creatures are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to God, as the Author of them all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he gives them force and power, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs together with them, as the univerſal effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cauſe; ſo all the merits of the Juſt, are referred to Chriſt, as the Author of them all, becauſe he gives them all the virtue and ſtrength which they have, and concurs together with them, as the univerſal merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſe. I omit many other things, which might be ſaid of this Matter.</p>

               <head>The Second Conſideration, in that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all Licentiouſneſs to Sin.</head>
               <p>THat Religion alſo is to be preferr'd as moſt acceptable to God, which admits of no Licenſe to Sin; but has many ways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to it ſelf to hinder it. For, as the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is of God, ought to animate, and allure Men's Minds to the ſtudy of good Works; ſo likewiſe it ſhould deterr them from ſinning, by teaching them the fear of God, and (as much as poſſibly it can) by preventing all Sin.</p>
               <p>Now it plainly appears, that ſuch is the Catholick Religion, which has many particular ways to cut off all Licenſe to Sin.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the Sacrament of <hi>Pennance.</hi> For many are extremely afraid to ſin, when they perceive themſelves obliged to reveal in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion all their peculiar Crimes, and undergo a Penance for them; and if they have wrong'd their Neighbour by Word or Deed, they are bound to make Reſtitution, and Satisfaction. Then again, in this Sacrament, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a hearty ſorrow for our Sins, and purpoſe of amendment of Life; thereby alſo is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Grace and Aſſiſtance from God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the Doctrine of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Purgatory.</hi> For it teacheth, that after the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44335:14"/>Guilt and eternal Puniſhment of Sin is remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there remains oftentimes the Obligation of a grievous temporal Puniſhment; which if it be not expiated (in this life) by good Works, that is, by Prayer, Alms, Faſting, and the like, we muſt ſuffer (after this Life) the moſt bitter Torments of Purgatory. For God permits no Sin to eſcape unpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By teaching that we incurr Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation by one mortal Sin, unleſs it be blotted out by true Repentance in this Life; and that Faith avails nothing to the pardon of our Sins, without true Repentance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By imprinting on Man's Mind the Fear of God ſeveral ways; as by putting us in Mind of the variety of God's Judgments. who will never have us ſecure of our Salvation, but always watch and pray, always remain ſober, and bent to good Works, leſt ſome time, perchance, we fall into Temptation, or be ſupplanted by the deceit of the Devil, or trip by Inconſideration; or being unprepar'd, be ſurpris'd by ſudden Death. Hence we ſee in good Catholicks (who earneſtly endeavour to live according to their Religion) a wonderful Solicitude and Care to avoid Sin; and if (through Humane Frailty) they offend, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they expiate and amend them.</p>
               <p>Now, no other Religions do theſe things; but do rather rid Men of all the fear of God, and open a great Gate to all Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44335:15"/>Firſt, In taking away the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confeſſion,<note place="margin">They take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Fear of God, and give a free ſcope to Sin.</note> by which (as is aforeſaid) Men are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully reſtrained from Sin. For they call it Man's Invention, the Murther of Conſciences, and meer Superſtition. 'Tis ſtrange, that any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, or humane Invention, ſhould have ſo great a Power, to make People reform their Lives, and gain Peace of Conſcience. This Vertue, even the <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, being taught by Experience. For <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> reports (who was preſent) when the Emperor was in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>

               <p>This Addreſs (ſays <hi>Sotus</hi>) made the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror laugh: For if, by Divine Authority, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not oblig'd to confeſs their ſecret Sins, and that a Prieſt has no Power to abſolve them (according to their Doctrine) how could they imagine (by any Humane Ordinance, without benefit of Pardon) they could be compell'd to it?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe they do not only aboliſh Confeſſion, but alſo the Virtue of Repentance;

                  </note> than the Ceremonies of the Old Law; and all Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to keep them, is totally abrogated by the Coming of Chriſt; that is to ſay, the violation of them is no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Believers, than the violation of the Ceremonial Law. That all theſe things are taught by them, is manifeſt, by the Quotations in the Margent, and well known by all thoſe that are any thing acquainted with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of theſe Sects.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being ſo, 'tis moſt clear and manifeſt, that by ſuch means the Fear of God is utterly baniſhed from the Hearts of Men, and the Reins let looſe to all manner of Sins: Nay, that there is as great Licentiouſneſs cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by theſe Religions, as by Atheiſm, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater. For, if no Sin is imputed to him (as to the Fault or Puniſhment) who has but this <hi>ſpecial</hi> Faith, why may he not venture to commit the moſt horrible Crimes? For what ſhould he fear? Hell or Purgatory? But his Faith tells him, that although Sin in its ſelf is grievous and odious, yet it ſhall not be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. Should he fear the Wrath of God, and Subtraction of his Grace? But God does not impute Sin to him, and cannot be angry with him, by reaſon of Chriſt's Satisfaction. Should he be afraid of temporal Satisfaction and Confeſſion? But theſe are taken away, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44335:16"/>ſuperſtitious. What then ſhould he ſtand in fear of, more than an Atheiſt? Or, how is not the Door as open to him, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all manner of Wickedneſs, as to the Atheiſt? What the Atheiſt does, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture witneſſeth, ſaying, <hi>The Fool hath ſaid in his Heart, there is no God; they are corrupted, and have done abominable Works; there is none that doth Good, no not one,</hi> Pſal. 13. The Atheiſt does this, by caſting off all fear of the Divine Vengeance, which keeps Mortals in awe, and curbs them from Sin: But theſe Religions do no leſs expel the fear of God's Chaſtiſement and Revenge, whilſt they teach that no Sin (as to guilt or puniſhment) is imputed to him that only believes, and that he ſhall never be puniſhed for it.</p>
               <p>Nay, I add farther, That this ſalutary Fear of God, is more extirpated by theſe Religions, than by Atheiſm: For few A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts hold, for certain, that there is no Deity; but many of them doubt, and fear the contrary; and therefore they are not without ſome fear of Vengeance to fall upon them, which makes them abſtain from many Sins. But theſe Religions hold for certian and undoubtedly, that Sins are not imputed to Believers, and therefore they quite caſt off all fear and apprehenſion of puniſhment. For this Reaſon, they far more ſlacken the reins of licentiouſneſs to perpetrate all kind of Wickedneſs than Atheiſts do.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Secondly, By Teaching, That all who have true Faith are predeſtinated, and that they ought to believe ſo with all certainty. For, if all Believers of theſe Sects are predeſtinated,<note place="margin">

                  </note> By taking away Free-Will, and Teaching, that all things are done by an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable neceſſity; that Man is unable to make his ways good or bad: For if there is Liberty, there is properly no Sin; as a Lyon by devouring a Man, though he does a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, yet he ſins not; becauſe he does it not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44335:17"/>freely, but by the impulſe of Nature; nor is is it in his Power to moderate this impulſe. No Man will deſerve puniſhment, becauſe what he does is of neceſſity; therefore there will be no Hell, nor puniſhment after this Life: For it would be a great and intolerable Cruelty, that Men ſhould be condemned to Eternal Torments, for doing that which they cannot poſſibly avoid: Why then do they fear to follow the Luſts and Deſires of their Heart, and commit what Sins ſoever they liſt?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When they teach, That all the Works of Men (as well good as bad) are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated of God from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;<note place="margin">

For, if God equally operates good and bad in us, there is no reaſon why we ſhould fly Evil, or fear any puniſhment: For, God is not a Revenger of that, of which he himſelf is the Author; nor can he juſtly puniſh us for thoſe Crimes which he will have done, and which he forces us to do; for this were more than Tyrannical Cruelty, which is far from God.</p>
               <p>Hereby 'tis clearer than the Noon Day, that theſe Religions (four ways) ſhake off all fear of God from Men's Hearts, and give as great Licenſe to all manner of

               <head>The Third Conſideration from the Sanctity of the Profeſſors.</head>
               <p>THat Religion is to be preferred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in moſt are famous for Holineſs of Life: For it cannot poſſibly be, that a bad Religion ſhould bring us to Piety, or that true San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity can conſiſt with a Wicked Religion. But the Catholick Religion has had many in all Ages, that have led moſt Holy Lives, by the General Confeſſion of all Chriſtians. Among whom (to ſingle out ſome of each Age, and omitting innumerable others) I reckon the Great St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> St. <hi>Hilarion,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Thaumaturge,</hi> St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Myre,</hi> St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Symeon</hi> Sty lite, St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> St. <hi>Martin,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, St. <hi>Vauſt,</hi> St. <hi>Amand,</hi> St. <hi>Wineck,</hi> St. <hi>Bertin,</hi> St. <hi>Willebrord,</hi> St. <hi>Romuald,</hi> St. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> St. <hi>Boniface,</hi> St. <hi>Bruno,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> St. <hi>Francis,</hi> St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin,</hi> St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> and many in our own Age. That all theſe were of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion is not to be doubted, ſince they adhered to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, made profeſſion of her Faith, and ſtrongly maintained it; and becauſe likewiſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44335:19"/>a great many of them were Monks, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, by their Vows, to lead a Monaſtick Life; yea, all the Rules of Monaſtick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſprung from them. That theſe were moſt Holy Men, is verifyed by the general Confeſſion of all Chriſtians, throughout ſo many Ages, wherein each of them lived; nor was there ever any queſtion made of it; the ſame being confeſſed by Hereticks, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> and St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi> It would therefore be a great abſurdity and impudence to deny the Truth of that (or in the leaſt queſtion it) which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the general conſent of all the World.</p>
               <p>If theſe Men therefore were Saints, and Catholicks, (as all the World believes,) the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion (which they held and profeſſed) muſt neceſſarily be the true Religion, and proceed from the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe 'tis impoſſible, that a falſe Religion can bring us to true Sanctity; for Religion is the Foundation of Sanctity: That Celeſtial Edifice cannot be built upon a vain thing, upon a pernicious and ſacrilegious Lye, as every Lye in Religion is. It cannot be, that a falſe Religion ſhould withdraw the Mind from Earthly Things, and raiſe it to Heavenly; that it ſhould inflame the Heart with Divine Love, and urge it to have a care of our Neighbour's Salvation, with ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44335:19"/>much pains and Labour. Now the Holy Catholick Religion (which theſe Men profeſſed and practiced) perfected all theſe things in them, and therefore it cannot poſſibly be falſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Without the true Religion it is <hi>impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11. But, by the conſent of all, theſe Men pleaſed God, and were his great Friends: Therefore their Religion was true: For how, by a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, could they pleaſe God, who is the Truth?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If their Religion was not true, and from God, then 'twas from the Devil: For <hi>he is a Lyer from the beginning, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lies,</hi> Jo. 8.44. He hath always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived (by his Lyes and Deceits) to deprave and corrupt the true Religion, to the end to deſtroy Men's Souls. If it were from the Devil, how could it bring them to ſo great Sanctity and Piety, and make them the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Adverſaries, and Friends of God? For what Society hath Juſtice with Iniquity? What Communion hath Light with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And what Agreement hath Chriſt with <hi>Belial?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, 'Tis altogether incredible, that God ſhould permit ſo many innocent Men, ſo great Deſpiſers of themſelves, and all Earthly things, ſo ſtudious of the Divine Glory, and ſuch ardent Lovers of God, to be deceived for ſo many Ages, in a matter
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44335:20"/>of ſo great Concern, as the buſineſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is the Foundation of all Piety. Who can ſo wickedly cenſure the Goodneſs of God? They omitted nothing on their ſide, whereby to pleaſe God, to advance his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory, they undertook the greateſt Labours and Difficulties for his ſake, and did wholly conſecrate and devote themſelves to his ſervice. How can it poſſibly be, that this infinite Goodneſs, <hi>this true Light which enlightneth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> Jo. 1.9. ſhould not ſhew his true Light, and Truth to ſuch eminent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Servants, but leave them in Darkneſs and Mortal Errours? That would then be falſe, which our Lord (with double and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Promiſes) ſo often ſaid, <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you; ſeck, and you ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you; for every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that ſeeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened,</hi> Matth. 7.7. Luk. 11.</p>
               <p>For S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> S. <hi>Francis,</hi> S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> and other Lights and Miracles of the World, all their Life-time, earneſtly craved, ſought, and knock'd to obtain of our Lord what was neceſſary to Salvation, and to know his Divine Will in all things, that they might do it; and yet were never the nearer, and got nothing. That Speech of our Bleſſed Saviour will likewiſe prove falſe, <hi>If you being evil know how to give good
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44335:20"/>Gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the good Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Joh. 11.13. For the good Spirit cannot be had without a good Religion. I omit other things which to this purpoſe might be alledged.</p>
               <p>But if it be Blaſphemy to ſay, that God's Promiſes are falſe, we muſt needs confeſs, that theſe Men received of our Lord the true Faith and Religion. Wherefore, ſince 'tis manifeſtly apparent, that they were of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, and ſtedfaſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and deteſted any other Faith and Religion contrary to it; 'tis not to be doubted, but that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion is the true Religion, and inſpired of God, and all other falſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Devil.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if their Religion were falſe, and that of any of our Adverſaries true, we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily grant, that all thoſe men aforeſaid whom the World ever eſteemed Saints) were not only no Saints, nor the Friends of God, but alſo impious, and Enemies of God, and for that cauſe damn'd to eternal Torments. For, without the true Religion it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb</hi> 11. Neither can it be ſaid, that they were excuſable for their Ignorance: Becauſe Ignorance excuſeth not, but only in ſome leſs principal things, and which are leſs neceſſary, being ſo only by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome poſitive Precept; and not in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44335:21"/>Fundamentals and firſt Principles. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, every one might be ſaved without any knowledge of God or Chriſt, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture. But if theſe erred (as our Adverſaries would have it) they erred in the chiefeſt Points: 1ſt, becauſe they did not acknowledge a <hi>ſpecial</hi> Faith, by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone we are juſtified, and made partakers of Chriſt's Redemption and Juſtice, and Sins not imputed to us, as the Authors of theſe new Religions teach. Therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in their Sins; were deſtitute of Chriſt's Juſtice, and conſequently the Children of Hell. 2dly, Becauſe, by their own Judgment and Confeſſion, they were not of the Church of Chriſt (out of which, by the conſent of all, there is no Salvation) but adher'd to the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> (for ſo they call the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) and were the Miniſters, and chief Inſtruments of Anti-Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3dly, Becauſe they were Idolaters, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Creature (namely, Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt) inſtead of Chriſt, honouring Saints, and their Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no Ignorance which can excuſe theſe things. Therefore all theſe Men were wicked and condemned to Hell-Torments. But how improbable and incredible is all this, and even againſt the Common Sence of all Chriſtians, that have hitherto been? Mean while in all other Religions, it is ſufficiently manifeſt, that none have ever appear'd of ſuch eminent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44335:21"/>Sanctity, in their Life and Converſation, as to breed Admiration in the World. For none could ever be named. Their firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were earthly minded, and addicted to Worldly Pleaſures, nothing exceeding in their Lives above the Vulgar; nay, rather guilty of the greateſt Crimes. But of this, more ſhall be ſaid hereafter.</p>
               <p>Nor does it ſignifie any thing, to ſay, that alſo amongſt Catholicks there are many,<note place="margin">An Objection refuted.</note> which are ſo far from leading holy Lives, that they defile their Souls and Bodies with fundry Vices. For they do not this by the grant and leave of their Religion, which prohibits them, and uſes all means poſſible (by threats, puniſhments and promiſes) to prevent and deter them. Therefore their evil Life is (in no wiſe) to be attributed to their Religion, nor can it argue the ſame to be imperfect. For, ſince there are three things to divert Man from Evil, and excite him to Good; that is, the fear of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hope of Reward, and the beauty of good Works; theſe three things the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion moſt excellently propoundeth, and inculcates every where to her Profeſſors. Therefore it omits nothing to make them ſly Sin, and encourage them to Vertue and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And if any don't aſpire to it, we muſt not impute it to their Religion, but their Free Will, which fruſtrates and contradicts
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44335:22"/>all theſe motives and encouragements. But indeed, if Catholick Religion ſhould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the fear of Puniſhment, and hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and declare all good Works to be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with the ſtain of Sin; then the pravity of Men's Lives, and neglect of good Works, might worthily be aſcrib'd to it. For, as he that takes away the buttreſſes, and props of a houſe (which keeps it from falling) is the cauſe of the houſe's Ruine; ſo he that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the fear of God, or future Puniſhment (whereby Men are reſtrain'd and kept back from falling into the gulph of Sin) is the cauſe of their ruine. Likewiſe, he that takes away all that, which is wont to animate to the ſtudy and practice of good Works, is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſuch neglect and contempt of good Works.</p>
               <p>Hereby is manifeſt, that the neglect of good Works, and the evil Life (which are diſcerned in ſome Catholicks) are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to their Religion, but only to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their Will: But in <hi>Lutherans, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi> and other Profeſſors of new Religions, it is to be imputed properly to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which takes away all thoſe things that are a hindrance to Evil, and encouragement to Good, as plainly appears by their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in their Books afore mentioned; not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding alſo in them that <hi>Free Will,</hi> by which they become guilty in chuſing and adhering to ſuch a falſe Religion.</p>

               <head>The Fourth Conſideration from the Miracles of its Profeſſors.</head>
               <p>THat Religion, wherein moſt Miracles have been done in all Ages, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before others which are without Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. For Miracles are a kind of Seals, and certain divine Evidences, whereby Religion is authoriz'd and approv'd. For ſince many things in Religion are above Nature, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humane Capacity, and cannot be prov'd by natural reaſon, there is need of certain ſupernatural Arguments to convince Men. Theſe are Miracles. But the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion only is famous for Miracles; therefore the only true Religion, and to be eſteemed above all others, as that only which hath God for its Witneſs. Now, that many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles have been done, in Confirmation of the Catholick Religion throughout all Ages (ſince Chriſt's and his Apoſtles time) is evident to all Chriſtians, by divers Hiſtories, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Kingdoms, and the Lives and Acts of Saints.</p>
               <p>But our Adverſaries ſay, theſe Miracles are not true,<note place="margin">Calv. p. fac. in Inſtit.</note> but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feigned, and partly diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical; The which is void of all probability. For, it is againſt the Judgment

For a Lie (in things pertaining to Religion) is a moſt grievous, mortal Sin, Then again, if they were falſe and feigned. the vanity of them might eaſily have been diſcovered, by the Men of that Age wherein they were written. But no body ever reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them, except Heathens, <hi>Jews,</hi> or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. Add hereunto, that many of theſe Miracles were confirm'd by the publick Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Biſhops, or Magiſtrates, through a previous knowledge of them. Laſtly, to ſay that they were falſe and counterfeited, is to take away all belief of Hiſtory, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all knowledge of former times. For all the Acts of Antiquity may be ſaid to be falſe and feigned, ſince they cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but by the Authority of the Writers.</p>
               <p>In like manner, that their Miracles were not wrought by help of the Devil, nor by the Devil, is manifeſt divers ways.</p>
               <p>1ſt, Becauſe they were done by moſt holy Men, and ſuch as were entirely devoted to God's Service. Who can believe that St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> St, <hi>Benedict,</hi> St. <hi>Martin,</hi> &amp;c. had any Commerce with the Devil? Again, becauſe their Works were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44335:24"/>far above the Devils Power. For the Devil cannot open the Eyes of the blind, nor cure the lame, nor raise the dead, nor give immediate cure to Paralitticks or reſtore dead and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Limbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe things are above the power of Nature. And hence never any Magicians could do ſuch ſuch things by the Devil's aid. But our Saints have done many ſuch Miracles, and almoſt innumerable, and that in a trice, by the touch only, or by the ſign of the Croſs, by a ſhort prayer, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, only by a word of Command. 3dly, Becauſe thoſe which are done by the Art of the Devil, either continue but a little while (being deluſions and deceptions of the Sight, as appears by that which Conjurers do) or if they laſt long, they are done by natural Cauſes, and exceed not the power of them. Moreover, they are (for the moſt part) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to Men, vain and hurtful; as to make Fire to deſcend from Heaven, to make a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Idol ſpeak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſhall be done by <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> and his falſe Prophets, in the laſt days, as 'tis written in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> Chap. 13. nor do they tend to amendment of Life. But the Miracles of the Saints have a permanent and ſolid effect, and are profitable to Mankind, exciting us to the fear of God, and amendment of our Lives. 4thly, New Miracles are never allowed of in the Church, but by great Examination before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44335:24"/>for Witneſſes are examined, and commonly under Oath; the Fact it ſelf is alſo looked into, whether 'twas not done by Virtue of Nature, or Help of the Devil; all Circumſtances are likewiſe conſidered, as by what means, order, and occaſion, in what place and time, to what end, and for whom, and before whom the Miracle was wrought: And oftentimes there are not wanting Perſons that are emulous, who are willing to undervalue and ſlight the matter overmuch, or endeavour what they can to render it ſuſpicious, and therefore they let nothing eſcape untry'd or unexamin'd: So that it is impoſſible the Fraud ſhould lie hid long, if there were any; and it concerns the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence not to permit Men to be ſo miſerably deluded, eſpecially after ſo great care and diligence uſed by them to find out the Truth. 5thly, If the Miracles of the Church were from the Devil, (to retain Men in a flaſe Religion,) Why does he not do the ſame in other falſe Religions; namely, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Turks, Arrians, Anabaptiſts, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines,</hi> &amp;c. Why does he forbear to work Miracles amongſt all theſe, and do them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Catholick Church? Is it becauſe he loves it better than all the reſt? But he ſhould not neglect them, by whom he may enlarge his Dominions. He is delighted with variety of falſe Worſhips, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates himſelf to the Genius, Diſpoſitions,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44335:25"/>and Affections of all. Therefore, ſince on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Catholick Religion hath Miracles, and no falſe Religion hath or can have them, 'tis a clear ſign, that the Miracles of the Catholick Church are not from the Devil. Laſtly, What reaſon is there, that they ſhould be counted Fictions, or performed by the Devil? Is it becauſe they cannot be done? But God is Omnipotent, and did many the like by his Apoſtles, as appears in Scripture. Or, is it becauſe they are repugnant to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? But our Lord hath plainly promiſed this Grace of Miracles, ſaying, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that believeth in me, the Works that I do, ſhall he do alſo, and greater Works than theſe ſhall he do, becauſe I go to my Father; and whatſoever you ſhall ask the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my Name, that will I do, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be glorified in the Son,</hi> Joh. 14.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which Words he inſinuates, that the Gift of Miracles ſhall always remain in the Church, not only amongſt the Apoſtles, but many Apoſtolical Men, and People of eminent Sanctity in due time and place. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe therefore of our Lord we ſee fulfilled, when Holy Men do Miracles. Or is it for lack of Witneſſes? Beſides the Writers, (moſt worthy of belief,) we have the credit and conſent of the People, the Teſtimony of Biſhops and Magiſtrates, after a ſtrict enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and examination of the matter, by Sworn Witneſſes. There are not any ancient Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44335:25"/>of Fact (except thoſe recorded in the Holy Scriptures) which have ſo many and ſo conſiderable Witneſſes. Add hereunto, that in every Age, yea, almoſt every year there are many great <hi>Miracles</hi> done in ſeveral places, by the Saints reigning with Chriſt in Heaven, eſpecially by the moſt bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> which in the places where they are wrought, are manifeſt to all, and may he ſeen by every one with their Eyes, and felt with their Hands; which alſo (after a ſtrict examination by ſworn Witneſſes, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teſtimonies) are confirm'd.</p>

               <head>The Fifth Conſideration from the Converſion of Nations.</head>
               <p>THat Religion is to be eſteemed the true Religion of Chriſt, and therefore to be embrac'd, to which there has been a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Nations. For our Lord hath, in divers places of holy Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.12.21. <hi>Oſea</hi> 1. <hi>Matth.

But the <hi>Religion</hi> to which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in all Ages have been converted, is the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> and therefore not to be doubted, but that it is the true <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this <hi>Religion</hi> to which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have been always and even lately converted, is the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> it is manifeſt by the things which have been done in this and former Ages. In this Age innumerable have been, and daily are converted in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> in <hi>Japan,</hi> in the great Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> and many Iſlands of the <hi>Indian Sea.</hi> Likewiſe in <hi>America</hi> where are many and ſpacious Kingdoms. All theſe came over to the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and were joined to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that by <hi>Religious Mon,</hi> ſent, for this end and purpoſe, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Holineſs the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:44335:27"/>And to look back to the foregoing Ages. In the Fourteenth Age, one <hi>Vincentius Ferrerius,</hi> a <hi>Dominican,</hi> converted to the Catholick Faith Five and Twenty Thouſand, partly <hi>Jews</hi> and partly <hi>Sarazens;</hi> as St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus,</hi> a Writer of the ſame Age, witneſſeth, 3 <hi>p.

               <p>In the Thirteenth Age, many in <hi>Tartary</hi> were converted to the Catholick Religion, by two <hi>Dominicans,</hi> ſent by the Pope, at the inſtance of their Emperor. which they call the Great <hi>Cham;</hi> as <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, who was an Agent to that Emperor.</p>
               <p>In the Twelfth Age were converted the People of <hi>Norway,</hi> by <hi>Adrian</hi> the Fourth, before he was Pope, as <hi>Platin</hi> writes in his Life.</p>
               <p>In the Eleventh Age, the greateſt part of <hi>Hungary</hi> was converted, and Biſhops ſent them by the Pope, at the requeſt of their King, St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> ſoon after his Converſion, as the <hi>Centuriators</hi> tell us, <hi>Cent.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>In the Tenth Age, many Kingdoms were converted by means of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and two Arch Prelates, as the <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riators</hi> note, <hi>Cent.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>In the Ninth Age, the <hi>Vandals, Bulgarians, Sclavonians, Polonians, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Moravians</hi> were converted, and united to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: So the <hi>Cent.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44335:28"/>In the Eighth age, moſt part of <hi>Germany</hi> was converted by S. <hi>Boniface,</hi> ſent to that end, by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Second, <hi>Cent.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>In the Seventh age, the <hi>Franks</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by S. <hi>Kilian,</hi> who received his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Cent.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>In the Sixth age, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Catholick Faith, by <hi>Monks</hi> ſent into <hi>England</hi> by the authority of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p>In Fine, Who converted <hi>Brabant, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Holland, Freeſland, Weſtphaly, France,</hi> and other bordering Nations?

Wulfranus,</hi> and others, who were all devoted to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which it appears, that all Nations, that have been converted to Chriſt, from Paganiſm, or Judaiſm, for above a Thouſand Years, were converted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Faith, and adhered to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as appears not only by what has been already ſaid; but is more clearly manifeſt by the Prieſts, Altars, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs, Veneration of Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and Images, Pilgrimages, Invocation of Saints, Monaſteries, Monks, Obedience to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other things proper
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44335:28"/>to the Catholick Religion, which hath ever flouriſhed among theſe nations, ever ſince their Converſion, till of late they were aboliſhed by theſe New Religions. Who that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders theſe things, can doubt, but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholick Religion is the true Religion of Chriſt? In it we ſee this Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Converſion of Nations fulfilled. Hereunto ſo many Peoples, ſo many remote Nations, ſo many potent Kingdoms have fled and forſaking their Idols, impurity of Life, multiplicity of Wives, barbarity of Manners, and former licentiouſneſs, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtoop to the yoke of Chriſt, have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the fear of God, conformed to an honeſt Life, and were inflamed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, and love of Heaven. How can it be, that this Religion ſhould be falſe and impious, which makes ſo great a change in the Minds of barbarous People?</p>
               <p>To conclude, how can it be, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence (for ſo many Ages) ſhould permit all theſe Nations to be deceived, (when they willingly forſook their Idolatry, imbraced the Truth, and united themſelves to the Church of Chriſt) and be plunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other pernicious Errors, and a new Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; and that by thoſe, who in the Church were eſteemed by every one the moſt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters thereof, as being famous for Holineſs of Life, Wiſdom, and Miracles? God forbid we ſhould ſo judge of the Divine
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44335:29"/>Goodneſs and Providence, which has ſo much care for the Salvation of Men.</p>
               <p>But now, on the other ſide, there has never been any Converſion of Nations made by the <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> never any acceſſion of Pagan Kingdoms to their Religion, but only a Revolt of thoſe, who, bearing the Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but weary of their former Religion and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, have followed their Novelties and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Fleſh; which is a clear Argument of Hereſie: For Hereſie is nothing elſe but a corruption of the Catholick Doctrine, and revolt of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from the Primitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, retaining ſtill the <hi>Chriſtian Name;</hi> and it is the ſtudy of Heretical Doctors, not to convert Heathens, but to pervert <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:</hi> Therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> hits them home, <hi>Lib de Praeſcrip. What ſhall I ſay touching the Miniſtration of the Word, ſince it is their buſineſs not to convert Infidels, but to ſeduce Catholicks: They take greater Glory to ruine thoſe that ſtand, than pains to lift up them that are down: For this Work of theirs is not of their own building, but a demoliſhing of the Truth. They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our Church to raiſe their own; ſo that they can eaſier deſtroy the Houſe that ſtands, than raiſe a new Building out of ruines.</hi>

               <p>Now that all Miniſters of the Catholick religion deſcend from the Apoſtles (whether you regard the Power of <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) is manifeſt; for all her inferior Miniſters (eſpecially <hi>Sub-deacons, Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi>) are ordained by <hi>Biſhops;</hi> the <hi>Biſhops</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their <hi>Order</hi> from other <hi>Biſhops;</hi> and <hi>theſe</hi> again from <hi>others,</hi> and ſo upwards to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who receiv'd this <hi>Power</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> from his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, As my Father ſent me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I ſend you;</hi> and ſo muſt you ſend others; and ſo I am with you and them to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>As therefore, all Men, according to the Life of Nature, (by a long tract of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,) deſcend from <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo all the Miniſters of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> according

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44335:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>in him to all his Lawful Succeſſors: And alſo only thoſe who have not an <hi>ordinary,</hi> but a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated</hi> Authority in the Church, muſt have it from <hi>Parochial Paſtors,</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or the <hi>Pope:</hi> So that there is no <hi>Miniſter</hi> in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> no <hi>Preacher</hi> of God's Word, or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizer,</hi> who cannot ſhew plainly his <hi>Miſſion,</hi> and demonſtrate the ſame to be derived from Chriſt: And indeed, if they could not do ſo, they were in no wiſe to be heard, but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and eſteemed as <hi>Wolves in Sheeps-cloathing, ſince they enter not into the Sheep-fold by the door, but creep in privately another way,</hi> Joh. 10.</p>
               <p>This Argument alwas the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> chiefly made uſe of,<note place="margin">Irenae. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> Tertul. de pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrip.</note> to convince all <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> for by it, the Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Religion (from ſeveral Ages up to the time of the Apoſtles) is clearly ſhew'd. <hi>The Succeſſion of Prieſts, from the See of St.</hi> Peter <hi>the Apoſtle (to whom our Lord commended the care of feeding his Sheep) to this preſent Biſhop,</hi>

               <p>But now none of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> Religions can ſhew this.

Likewiſe they never had any power of <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> to preach the word of God, as true <hi>Paſtors,</hi> or to adminiſter Baptiſm, and rule the People in Spirituals, and Divine Worſhip. For I ask, of whom had <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> this power? Of whom was either of them ſent to preach their New Goſpel and Reform the People? For they were not ſent by the <hi>Ordinary Paſtors</hi> of the Church, as 'tis ſufficiently manifeſt. They came therefore of their own accord, without any Authority or Commiſſion; which is a certain ſign they ought not to be believed, but rejected. <hi>For how ſhall they Preach except they be ſent?</hi> Rom. 10.15. <hi>He that entreth not by the door into the Sheep-fold, but climbeth up ſome other way, the ſame is a Thief and a Robber; but he that entreth in by the door is the Shepherd of the Sheep,</hi> Joh. 10.1. They enter not in by the door who uſurp the <hi>Paſtoral Office,</hi> without <hi>Ordinary</hi> or Lawful Authority.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Whether Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries are ſent by Chriſt.</note>But perhaps they will ſay, that they were ſent by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and received Authority from

               </p>
               <p>Again, how did <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſend them, when they teach ſuch different and <hi>contradictory</hi> Doctrine amongſt themſelves?

               <p>THat Religion is to be imputed to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to be preferred before all others, wherein there is an <hi>unanimous</hi> conſent of the chief <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> of every <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> ſince <hi>Chriſt,</hi> about points of Faith, which is an eaſie end to all Controverſies; and from which if you recede, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be relyed on, for a certainty: But ſuch is the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis the only true Religion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And, Firſt, Touching the conſent of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> about the <hi>Tenets</hi> of our Religion, it appears by their Writings: For as many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Doctors</hi> as have written in <hi>Greece,</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Affrica,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> are all <hi>conſenting</hi> to <hi>Free-Will, merit</hi> of <hi>Good Works,</hi> the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs</hi> for the Living and Dead, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick Vows, Faſtings, Feaſts, Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> &amp;c. which are diſowned by theſe <hi>New Religions;</hi> neither can the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> deny it; but ſay, theſe were the

But how impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable is this, that all the ancient Fathers, writing of theſe matters in divers places, with ſo general a conſent, ſhould err? For the conſent of many, eſpecially before they communiceate one with another, in the ſame opinion, is a great ſign of Truth, attracting their Minds to an unanimous conſent thereof, by divine illumination. For, 'tis the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>Truth</hi> (being but <hi>One</hi>) to joyn and <hi>unite</hi> in <hi>conſent;</hi> but of <hi>Falſity,</hi> being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, to <hi>diſperſe</hi> into ſundry Opinions and Errors.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that <hi>Hereticks,</hi> in ſeveral Countries, writing of the ſame ſubject, ſcarce ever agree; but are divided into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Opinions, having once forſaken the Truth.</p>
               <p>Again, there is no Tenet of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion can be ſhew'd, which has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a-new, by any in the <hi>Church;</hi> which is a manifeſt ſign, that it has <hi>always</hi> been in the <hi>Church,</hi> and deſcended from the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> For if it were brought in a-new, after the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> againſt <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Doctrine, it could be ſhew'd in <hi>what</hi> Generation or Age it was done, where, and by what <hi>Author,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:44335:36"/>and who <hi>oppoſed</hi> the ſame: For no new Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is ever raiſed, without great ſtir and contradiction. Therefore we can ſhew the riſe of all <hi>Hereſies,</hi> where, when, and by what <hi>Authors</hi> they firſt began, who oppoſed them, what ſtrifes they made, and finally what <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> condemned them. But if this can be demonſtrated of particular <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,</hi> how much more of the chiefeſt points of Religion, if any innovation were made in them?</p>
               <p>It is clear therefore, that our <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion, not only by the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> but alſo by <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> of Doctrine, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Lib. de Preſcrip.</hi> is continued, and accords with the Ancient and <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>That the Opinions of theſe New Religions diſagree with thoſe of the ancient <hi>Fathers, Hereticks</hi> themſelves abundantly confeſs; ſince, in the Chapters aforeſaid, they blame them of Superſtition, and averr they cannot be excuſed of Errour, as we ſhall ſee more at large hereafter.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of the Cath Church are eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed.</note>Secondly, The <hi>Controverſies</hi> that ſometimes ariſe in the <hi>Church,</hi> are eaſily decided, by the continual practice of the <hi>Church:</hi> For the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> hath an <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> of <hi>Controverſies,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> with a <hi>General

               <p>For all Reaſon requireth, that the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Religion (being common to the whole <hi>Church</hi>) ſhould not be judged by private Perſons that have obtained no Dignity nor Degree in the <hi>Church:</hi> but by the <hi>Supreme Paſtor</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> together with other particular <hi>Prelates,</hi> to whom the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of the <hi>Church</hi> is committed, and who are the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of the whole <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> As the <hi>Controverſies</hi> about Laws and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44335:37"/>Privileges of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> are decided by none but the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Chief</hi> Men who repreſent the whole <hi>Kingdom:</hi> For to thoſe who are made <hi>Superiors</hi> in any <hi>Community,</hi> Spiritual or Temporal, it belongs to allay Differences and decide Controverſies, about matters properly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to their Government, thereby to take away all contradiction for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>And indeed, unleſs the Church had this power, it would have been very imperfect, lamely inſtituted, and more miſerable than any Temporal Kingdom, or Common-Wealth: For there would never have been an end of Diſputes and Contentions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief points of Faith, no end of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions and Contradictions; and it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, in a ſhort time, have been divided into a Thouſand Sects, as we ſee it happens by the <hi>Conventicles</hi> of <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is, that in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> all points of Faith are certain and defined, and no <hi>variation</hi> made of them, and all <hi>Catholicks</hi> unanimouſly conſent acquieſce, and are ſatisfied in the belief of them.</p>
               <p>Hereby it follows, Thirdly, If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> you have no certainty to depend on, for the true way of Salvation: For what Religion will you

               </p>
               <p>Again, if you will imbrace the Religion of <hi>Luther,</hi> which ſort would you have, the <hi>mild</hi> or <hi>rigid?</hi> That pure Religion which <hi>Luther</hi> (the <hi>German</hi> Prophet) recommended, or that which <hi>Philip Melancton</hi> renewed? But this alſo is of divers ſorts; for the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion was often changed. If you are for <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Religion, why not <hi>Luther</hi>'s, ſince he is the <hi>Parent</hi> of all, and the firſt that brought into the World this new Light of the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>Again, if you are for <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Religion, whether that of <hi>Puritans</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> For they are very different, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> well know. I omit many differences wherein theſe Sects are divided. There is no ſolid Reaſon can be given, why you ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs one, for the certainly of it, rather than the other; ſince they all ſtiffly alledge the Word of God to be of their ſide, that they have the Spirit of god, and that the ſence of Scripture is clearly for their Doctrine, and that all the reſt are falſe, and manifeſtly againſt Scripture; nor can they otherwiſe prove it, but by ſaying, that 'tis clear to every one that has the Spirit. Therefore
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44335:38"/>they all urge the ſame reaſon for their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and rely on the ſame foundation. You muſt therefore be of all their Religions, or of none.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> proves her Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets far otherwiſe; namely, from <hi>Sacred Scripture,</hi> according to the <hi>expoſition</hi> of the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>all Ages;</hi> from the <hi>Sanctity, Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Prophetick Spirit</hi> of thoſe that profeſs this <hi>Religion;</hi> from the <hi>perpetuity</hi> and <hi>uniformity</hi> of Doctrine through all Ages: from the <hi>purity</hi> of Life, which this Doctrine induceth; from the <hi>Converſion</hi> of Nations to this Doctrine; and from all the other <hi>Conſiderations</hi> ſet down in the foregoing Chapters.</p>

               <p>ALL other Religions, beſides the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> expreſly and particularly, that of <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and the <hi>Fanatick</hi> (which I chiefly ſpeak of here) ought worthily to be ſuſpected, and abandoned, as Heretical Sects, for many Reaſons, which I ſhall here briefly commemorate, and referr to your ſerious Conſideration.</p>

                  <head>The Firſt Reaſon, from the Novelty of it.</head>
                  <p>ALL Novelty, or all <hi>New Cutts</hi> and <hi>Faſhions</hi> (as St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> calls it) in any Government (and chiefly in the Affair of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) are to be ſhunn'd and avoided. The Chriſtian religion is an ancient ſolid, and immutable thing, intended to laſt to the end of the World: For it is the Form, Strength, and as it were the Soul of Chriſt's Church; for as by the Soul the Fleſh is animated into a Living Man; ſo by religion, an Aſſembly of Men (who otherwiſe, of themſelves are but carnal) is formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of Chriſt, which is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom, As therefore the Church and Kingdom of Chriſt is ancient, and never to be rooted out, as <hi>againſt which the Gates of Hell</hi> (that is to ſay, no Herefies, or other wicked attempts) <hi>ſhall ever prevail,</hi> Mat. ult. and with which Chriſt has promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the end of the World.<note place="margin">De Auguſt de utit. caeden. c. <hi>17.</hi>
                     </note> Such alſo muſt the <hi>Religion</hi> be by which this Church and Kingdom of Chriſt do ſubſiſt. Therefore Novelty is repugnant to the true <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:44335:39"/>But that theſe are <hi>New Religions,</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe we can ſhew the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them, the place, time, and manner how they began, who reſiſted them, what great Commotions, Troubles, and <hi>Mobbs</hi> were raiſed by reaſon of them; and finally, by whom they were condemned. Now, what clearer ſigns can there be of Novelty? In the ſame manner, all Hereſies, introduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Doctrine, are convinced of Novelty; becauſe we can ſhew how they crept into the Church, at what time they began, in what place, by what Author, who oppoſed and condemned them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Before the year of our Lord 1517. <hi>Luther</hi>'s religion was not in the World, nor <hi>Calvin</hi>'s, nor the other <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,</hi> which are but two branches of the <hi>Lutheran Religion:</hi> For it appears by Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of that time, wherein <hi>Luther</hi> firſt ſhew'd Head, that there was no religion in the World, but the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> (and a very few <hi>Hereticks,</hi> called <hi>Huſſites</hi>) except the <hi>Judaick, Mahometan,</hi> and <hi>Pagan Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If you ſhould ſay, that <hi>ſome</hi> of them were exiſtent in the World; namely, the <hi>Lutheran Religion,</hi> &amp;c. but lay hid; I
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44335:40"/>ask, in what place it was, in what King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in what Town, who were the Defenders or Maintainers of it? Laſtly, How do you know it was in Being before, ſince it could not be manifeſt but by Writers, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no ſuch thing, but the contrary. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, when there were in every place, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors</hi> of <hi>Hereſies,</hi> how could this <hi>Religion</hi> lie hid ſo many hundred years, and not be diſcovered; and never any one of the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of it fall into their Hands and be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected? Never any Heretical Sect could ſo hide it ſelf, but be often taken, and publickly called in queſtion and examination. Again, if this religion was in the World before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> why did not the Profeſſors of it (who have hitherto lay hid) come forth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him as a Doctor of their Faith, and a Champion of their religion? Why did they not appear in publick, and join with him, as their Partner and Patron, who had ſet at liberty their religion, before ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and perſecuted? But no ſuch ever appeared, that had been of this religion, before him; but all of them were of the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> before they turned to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf (before he revolted) was a <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> and a <hi>Friar;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">L. de Miſſa au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular &amp; l. <hi>2</hi> contr. Swingl.</note> and ſaid Maſs ſeriouſly and devoutly fifteen years together, as himſelf confeſſeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:44335:40"/>Whereby it is clearer than the Sun at noon day, that <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Religion</hi> is altogether new, and was unknown to the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time: Not any Congregation of Men, and perhaps no ſingle perſon was ever in Being before him, that profeſſed the ſame Religion; that is, all the ſame points of Faith, his whole Body of Doctrine. For although he might hold <hi>ſome</hi> Opinions of ancient <hi>Hereticks,</hi> yet the <hi>Relagion</hi> of <hi>Luther</hi> and the ancient <hi>Hereticks</hi> is not therefore the ſame, but in part. For <hi>Religion</hi> is a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex,</hi> or comprehenſion of all thoſe things which pertain to Faiths. But no body (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him) ever taught all the ſame Tenets.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo convinc'd by another reaſon; for 'tis manifeſt, the ancient <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> floriſhing in former Ages, were not of <hi>Lutheran</hi>'s Religion; <q>for They all confeſs <hi>Free-Will,</hi> the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Good Works, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> of life eternal, and <hi>poſſibility</hi> of keeping Gommandments: They approve of the <hi>Invocation</hi> of Saints, the <hi>Veneration</hi> of holy Relicks and Images, the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs</hi> for the living and dead, the <hi>Ordination</hi> of Miniſters, the Evangelical <hi>Counſils</hi> of <hi>Monaftick</hi> Vows, the cuſtom of <hi>Faſting</hi> in <hi>Lent,</hi> &amp;c. all which <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Religion</hi> denies, and denounces as ſuperſtitious, injurious to God, and wicked.</q> That the ancient Fathers confeſs and approve all theſe things, is clear by their Writings; nor can <hi>Lutherans</hi> and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44335:41"/>
                     <hi>Calviniſts</hi> deny the fame, but ſay, they were the <hi>Spots</hi> of the ancient Fathers: beautiful ſpots indeed; Superſtition, Idolatry, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. But if the <hi>Doctors</hi> of former Ages were not of this <hi>Religion,</hi> but always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry'd and condemn'd the ſame, 'tis evident that it is not <hi>Ancient,</hi> but <hi>New.</hi> Now, in the <hi>Church,</hi> there is no <hi>Religion</hi> taken for the true <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> beſides that which the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> have held.</p>
                  <p>Hence it plainly follows, that the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran Religion</hi> is not the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Religion</hi> is not new, but old: But <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Religion</hi> is new, and not old, as 'tis ſhewed. The Religion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> has been always in the World, from the time of the Apoſtles; but the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Luther</hi> has not been always, but began in the year of our Lord, 1517, as aforeſaid. Again, if <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s <hi>Religion</hi> is the true <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Congregation of People, holding this <hi>Religion,</hi> is the true Church of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> (as has been declared) becauſe the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Religion (which conſtituted this <hi>Church</hi>) was not before <hi>Luther.</hi> If you ſay, it was in the Apoſtles time, and ſome Ages heretofore, it is to be proved, there were ſome then living that held all <hi>Luther</hi>'s Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets: We can for certain, and with eaſe prove the contrary: <q>For it is aparent, the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44335:41"/>Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs</hi> for the living and the dead, Ordnation of Miniſters, Monaſtical Vows, and the like (which are repugnant to <hi>Luthers</hi> Religion) were in the Church of God in the Apoſtles time, and the Ages neareſt to it.</q> Moreover, ſupoſing, but not granting, that that it had been in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time, and ſome time after, yet at leaſt in the Third and Fourth Age it began to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and be quite loſt, which alſo the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Doctors confeſs in the Book of <hi>Centuries</hi> publiſhed by them. Therefore,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cent.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. cap. 4.</note> for 1300. years, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> fell away and periſhed: For at leaſt, ſo long it is manifeſt, the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Religion was not, but what florished was point blank contrary to it. The true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then, for ſo ſo many Ages was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, the Goſpel obſcured, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> overthrown, till <hi>Luther</hi> (the <hi>German</hi> Prophet) roſe, and diſpell'd this mortal darkneſs, brought into the World the light of the Goſpel, and repaired the ruines of the Church. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> in ſeveral Towns of <hi>Germany,</hi> declare this in writing upon the Frontiſpiece of their Houſes (in Capital Letters) in theſe or the like words, in <q>ſuch a year, the true light of Chriſt's Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel shin'd firſt in this City, by abolishing Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> Now if the Church of Chriſt had perished for ſo many Ages, how is it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44335:42"/>true that it was built upon a Rock, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. and not rather upon Sand? How is it true, that the Gates of Hell shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it? How is the Houſe of God the Ground and Pillar of Faith? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. How is the Kingdom of Chriſt (which is th Church) ſtable, firm, eternal, and never to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>If you ſay, the Church and <hi>Lutheran</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath continued in all Ages from the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but lay hid, it is more than can be proved, and without any probability, as hath been demonſtrated. But les us grant it to be hid; therefore it was not the Church of Chriſt: For the Church of Chriſt is like a City placed upon a Hill, which cannot be hid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. She is the Mountain of our Lord's Houſe, eſtablished in the top of the Mountains, and exalted above the Hills, conſpicuous to all, and all Nations shall flow unto it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. She is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from Sea to Sea, and from the River unto the ends of the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. She is that great Mountain which filled the whole Earth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. For the Church of Chriſt ought to be manifeſt, that by her Worship, Splendor, Manners, and outward Form, the Nations might be attracted to her, and that thoſe who deſire to be made Chriſtians might know whom to go to, adviſe with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtructions from. In like manner her Doctrine and Belief ought to be manifeſt, or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44335:42"/>elſe 'twould be unprofitable to the World, and could not convert Nations. Therefore in the time of Perſecutions, it was never ſo obſcure, but every where known, as Eccleſiaſtical Writers tell us. And from hence came ſuch a multitude of Martyrs. Again, if it lay dormant ſo many Ages, it was altogether unworthy of the Chriſtian name: For how could this be call'd the true Church of Chriſt, which durſt not confeſs the ſincere Doctrine of Chriſt? But was of ſuch a cowardly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo affraid of death, as to hide it ſelf in the dark, and not dare for ſo many Ages, to appear in the light. Nay, did not only hide her ſelf ſo many Ages, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſincere Profeſſion of Faith, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo confeſs a falſe Faith (namely, the Papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal) adore Idols, and defile her ſelf with a thouſand Superſtitions, and Sacriledges? For before <hi>Luther,</hi> all Chriſtians (in outward ſhew at leaſt) behav'd themſelves like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, or elſe they would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently taken by the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and puniſhed as <hi>Heriticks:</hi> So that the Church of Chriſt would have been more miſerable and deformed than the ruines of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> (or the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sect) which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways held their Meetings in ſome places or other, and made a profeſſion of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor was ever compell'd (at leaſt in <hi>general</hi>) to the Worſhip of Idols. It would alſo have been more wretched, and in a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44335:43"/>worſe condition than all Heretical Sects. For, there has been no Sect of any name, which has not had their Churches, Preaching Houſes, or Conventicles, and ſome form and prtfeſſion of their religion, whereby it was known.</p>
                  <p>From theſe things it is clear, nothing can be more abſurd, than to ſay, that the Church of Chriſt (for ſo many Ages) abſconded. I conclude therefore with this <hi>Dilemma;</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> religion were before their Authors, or not: If not, then they are plainly Novelties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the <hi>Religian</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; but if they were exiſtent, then they were occult, and therefore could not be the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which hath been always viſible, manifeſt, and publick. What hath been ſaid and proved in this Diſcourſe againſt the religion of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> may be alſo ſaid of all other Proteſtants, whether <hi>Anabaptiſts, Independents, Quakers,</hi> and the like Hereſies; for there is the ſame Novelty in them all, and therefore the ſame reaſons may be urged againſt them; but for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, and not to cloy the <hi>Reader</hi> with repetition of Names, I have only made uſe of One or Two.</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore in the Words of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dialog. contr. Lucif. in fiae.</note> who writes thus, <hi>I'll tell you briefly and plainly my Opinion, We muſt live and die
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44335:43"/>in that Church, which being founded by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, remains to this day. If in any place you hear ſome who are called Chriſtians to derive a Name from ſome other Perſon, (beſides Jeſus Chriſt) as</hi> Marcioniſts, Valentinians, Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, (Lutherans, Calviniſts) <hi>&amp;c. know they are not of the Church of Chriſt, but the Synagogue of Antichriſt; For by this very token that they have been brought in under ſuch a Name in after Ages, they are known and convicted to be ſome of thoſe, whom the Apoſtle foretold: Nor let them flatter themſelves by quoting Scripture for their Tenets, ſince the Devil quoted Scripture alſo, which conſiſts not in the reading, but underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</hi> As Novelty therefore is a ſign of Hereſie foretold by the Apoſtle; ſo ſuch a Sectary Name a ſign of Novelty; and as for bringing of Scripture, it is common to the <hi>Devil,</hi> as well as <hi>Hereticks.</hi>

                  <p>Hereby it is clearly manifeſt, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> have neither of the ſaid powers of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> from the Apoſtles, and that they are not deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Apoſtles, according to either, nor can trace back either of theſe two from themſelves up to the Apoſtles; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that they have neither true <hi>Religion</hi> nor the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> among them: for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44335:45"/>this ought to deſcend, and be as it were continued from the Apoſtles, by the means of theſe two Powers, as hath been declared: For all Spiritual Power ought to be derived from Chriſt, by the Apoſtles and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, (through a certain continued Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and Communication,) upon other Miniſters, as our corporal Life (by a chain of Cauſes) is derived from the Firſt Man, <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo muſt be to the laſt Man that ſhall be born: For as in the Old Teſtament, none were to be Prieſts, unleſs they deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Aaron,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> ſo in the New Teſtament, none are <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> unleſs they derive their degree of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> from <hi>Chriſt</hi> (the Chief Biſhop) by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſors.</hi> As therefore the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> could not be without <hi>Prieſts</hi> deſcended from <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> by a continued Race; ſo the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be without <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> deſcending from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> by a perpetual continued <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</hi> But the <hi>Congregations</hi> of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> had never any ſuch Miniſters; they never had any Biſhops (lawfully ordained) amongſt them, that could derive their power of <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> from the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, to govern the People: 'Tis plain therefore, that they have not the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> amongſt them.</p>

                  <head>The Third Reaſon, from the defect of Miſſion.</head>
                  <p>THE Third Reaſon is, from a want of Miſſion; becauſe they introduced theſe Religions of themſelves, without any Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority. This therefore ſhould make them worthily to be ſuſpected as erroneous, and the Authors of them to be Wolves and Seducers: For no body in the Church ought to Preach, but thoſe that are ſent by Lawful Authority, according to the Apoſtle, <hi>How ſhall they Preach, unleſs they be ſent?</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a great confuſion would ſpring in the Church: For every one then would take upon him the Office of Preaching, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Church, and ſow what Errors he pleaſed: For if in a Temporal Republick, or Humane Government, no Man can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude himſelf, and aſſume the Magiſtracy to govern the People in Earthly Affairs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining only to this Life, but ought to have Commiſſion from the Prince; how much leſs in the Church, in the Spiritual Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> can any one arrogate to himſelf the Office of a Paſtor to govern the People, in things belonging to their Eternal Salvation; but ought to have Authority from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head of the Church? For a confuſion
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44335:46"/>of Government in the <hi>Church</hi> is much more to be avoided than in a Republick; ſince this tends to a deſtruction of Souls, whereas the other is but the loſs of our Fortunes or Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>He that entreth not by the door, into the Sheepfold, but climbeth up ſome other way, the ſame is a Thief and a Robber,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. But he that, without any Lawful Miſſion and Authority, aſſumes the Office of a Paſtor in the <hi>Church,</hi> does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the door, but climbeth up ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, as the Fathers every where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, and as 'tis plain enough of it ſelf: For, what is it elſe to enter by the door, than to enter by a Lawful way, by legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Authority? For a door is the ordinary way appointed, whereby to enter into the Sheepfold, and ſignifies this Lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whereby Miniſters ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Sheepfold of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and feed <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Flock.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, our Lord ſays by St. <hi>John, He that ſpeaketh of himſelf ſeeketh his own Glory; but he that ſeeketh his Glory that ſent him, the ſame is true, and no injuſtice is in him,</hi> Joh. 7.18. By which Words he ſignifies, we muſt not believe thoſe who come of themſelves, and are not lawfully ſent, becauſe they ſeek their own glory and profit, to which end all their Doctrine is directed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:44335:47"/>Laſtly, The Apoſtle, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> judges this Miſſion to be ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that he requires it in <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord: <hi>No Man taketh this Honour to himſelf, but he that is called of God,</hi> as Aaron: <hi>So Chriſt alſo did not glorifie himſelf, that he might be made a High Prieſt; but he that ſaid to him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> Hence it is, that our Lord ſo often inculcated to the <hi>Jews</hi> his <hi>Miſſion;</hi> namely, that he did not come of himſelf, but was ſent by his Father, and confirms the ſame many ways.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it is clear, that <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and the like new Doctors, are not to be heard, nor their Doctrine believed, but avoided and deteſted; becauſe 'tis apparent, they came of themſelves, without any Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority. It is evident, that they have uſurped to themſelves this Function and Duty of <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and a Right to Reform the <hi>Church.</hi> It is manifeſt, they entred not by the door, and by a legal way, but climb'd up another way, into the Sheepfold; and therefore, according to the Sentence of our Lord, they are to be taken for Thieves and Robbers.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps they will ſay, they were ſent immediately from <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt ſent them not.</note> as of old God ſent the Prophets, in an extraordinary manner, to Reform the People, and as <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:44335:47"/>ſent his Apoſtles to convert the World; and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> (after our Lord's Aſcention) was not ſent by Men, nor received the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel from Men, but immediately from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But, Firſt, 'tis not enough to ſay this, and boldly to affirm it, but they muſt prove it, and evince it to be true, leſt the People, and other ordinary <hi>Paſtors</hi> lawfully renounce them, as Impoſtors. As the Prophets of old, and the Apoſtles, did not only ſay, that God ſent them, but abundantly prov'd and demonſtrated the ſame, by many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All <hi>Arch Hereticks</hi> and falſe <hi>Prophet</hi> in all Ages, have ſaid the like; namely, that they were ſent of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Authority from him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all are to be imbraced or none: For why ſhould I believe (for example ſake) that God ſent <hi>Calvin</hi> rather than <hi>Luther, Munſter, Arrius,</hi> or any other <hi>Arch Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> ſince he cannot ſhew greater Proofs or Reaſons of his Miſſion, than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God ſent <hi>Calvin,</hi> then he did not ſend <hi>Luther;</hi> and ſo the contrary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if two Prophecy contradictions, and condemn one another (in their Doctrine) of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44335:48"/>reſie, they deſtroy the Religion of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherefore, if God ſent both of them, he ſhould be againſt himſelf, deny and overthrow himſelf, deſtroying by one, what he built up by the other. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Prophets which God ſent, there was always an exact agreement of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If God ſent <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> to reform the Church, I ask at what time, and in what place did God confer on them this Miniſtry? What Words did he ſay to them, either outwardly or inwardly? How did he declare to them the points of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, what order and method did he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them? How, or in what Form did he appear to them? Whither exteriourly, in a viſible manner, as he did to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly, by an imaginary Viſion, in ſome ecſtaſie, as to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and to S. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt in his <hi>Revelations?</hi> For all theſe things God is wont to do, when he ſends any One <hi>extraordinarily;</hi> and the Prophets themſelves, preſently, when they began to Preach, declared all this, that the People might underſtand by whom they were ſent, or what charge was given them; as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Prophet <hi>Iſai. Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c. Dan.</hi> 2. and 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In fine, all the <hi>Prophets</hi> were uſed to Evidence this in the firſt place; as you may ſee in their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. In like manner, it is known at what
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44335:48"/>time, and by what Words our Lord ſent his Apoſtles, and what he enjoyn'd them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe new Prophets were ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, that they never thought of this, to be reputed immediately ſent from God; for there is no mention hereof made by them; which is a moſt certain ſign, that they are compelled of neceſſity to tell a moſt grievous untruth, by ſaying, God ſent them: For who can doubt, if they had the leaſt colour of Divine Miſſion, they would not have inſerted it in their Writings, and preſently manifeſted the ſame to the whole World, expreſſing the time, place, manner, and precept of our Lord, together with other circumſtances?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If God ſent them, he did not only ſend them as <hi>Reformers</hi> of Manners (as the <hi>Prophets</hi> were ſent) but as <hi>Reformers</hi> of all Doctrine and Religion; and therefore an exact narration and deſcription of their <hi>Miſſion</hi> was chiefly neceſſary, and a nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the points which God would have reformed, and in his Name and Words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the Church; as the Prophets of old were uſed to do, when they propoſed to the People the Divine Commandments in the Name of God. But theſe New Prophets have not proceeded in this manner, but by chance, and as their matter required, they fell from one Opinion to another; as it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44335:49"/>happens in Diſputes and Contentions, when their Minds were more and more exaſperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as by experience they could learn how to accommodate themſelves in their Affairs, and incommode or undermine the <hi>Pope's Authority,</hi> which condemned them: For what ever they perceived would be moſt prejudicial to the <hi>See of Rome,</hi> or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to it, they decreed points of Faith accordingly, and varniſhed them over with the Word of God, as I ſhall ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, In <hi>Humane Policy,</hi> if any ſhould pretend Authority to govern, it is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſay, that he was ſent by the Prince of the Country, who was far of, and could not conveniently come himſelf; but he muſt ſhew his <hi>Patent,</hi> or <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> ſigned with the King's Seal, which then is diligently exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, leaſt there ſhould be any fraud in the caſe; and if there ſhould be the leaſt ſign of a ſhamm or cheat, it is not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, till a full and certain proof thereof be made. The ſame we ſee in the <hi>Apoſtolical Legates,</hi> who all ſhew their Patents authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, wherein their Miſſion and Commiſſion is contained, otherwiſe they are not credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor have Authority. What madneſs is it then to admit into the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, not only New Paſtors, but likewiſe Reformers of the whole Religion of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44335:49"/>the Church, only upon their ſaying that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent them, and that they have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, without ſhewing any Patent or Miracle to prove it?</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The account of time alſo, is ſtrongly againſt them; for if the <hi>Church</hi> fell away about 600 years after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> (as they teach,) Why was the Miſſion of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers delay'd to theſe times? Why did God forſake his Church 900 years together, and ſuffer it to continue in its ruines, in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Idolatry, as nothing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him; and after the accompliſhment of ſo many Ages, ſhould ſend firſt to her theſe New Reformers, or Chief Maſters? Is this the Love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> towards his <hi>Church, which he hath cleanſed with his Blood, which he hath quickened with his Spirit, and which he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted or choſen for his Spouſe?</hi> He ſhew'd himſelf much kinder to his Handmaid, the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> by ſending them many Prophets to reclaim them, ſtill prone to Idolatry and grand Impieties. Therefore, if theſe Men would have been thought Reformers, they ſhould have feigned the <hi>Church</hi> to have faln but a little before them, and not for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages to have lain putrified in its ruines. Otherwiſe, this long diſtance of time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes their Miſſion, and ſhews it to be very imprudently forged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:44335:50"/>Eightly, Hereunto may be added other moſt certain ſigns that Chriſt did not ſend them; as their <hi>vicious</hi> Life, Pride, contempt of the Holy Fathers, the Errors, and Lies, wherein they were taken; beſides their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of Doctrine, which I ſhall declare in the following Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, and Laſtly, They teach that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be believed, but what is in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Let them therefore ſhew, out of the Scriptures, that they were ſent by God to reform the Church. In what place, and by what Words of Scripture did our Lord give this Authority to <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin?</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we cannot believe them, being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Judges, nor receive them as <hi>Reformers</hi> of the Church.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot forbear to inſert a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous fancy of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> which yet made a great noiſe among them: They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to eſtabliſh the <hi>Miſſion</hi> of their Prophet, by a certain Prophecy of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> contained forſooth in this verſe, <hi>Tibi Cherubin et Seraphin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſabili voce proclamant;</hi> that is, <hi>To thee Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins and Seraphins continually do cry:</hi> For, ſome years ago, they erected an <hi>Effigies</hi> of <hi>Luther,</hi> cut in Braſs, with this Inſcription: <hi>A divine and wonderful Prophecy of St.</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe <hi>and St.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>ſhewing the time and coming of</hi> Luther, <hi>wherein he began to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44335:50"/>the</hi> Roman-Antichriſt, <hi>as it is contained in the Letters of this Verſicle, repreſenting the date of the year; which is a thing worthy the note and admiration of all Faithful Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>TIbI Cher<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bIn et SeraphIn InCeſſabILI VoCe proCLaMant.</q>
                  <p>The Numeral Letters of this Verſicle are 1517. in which year of our Lord <hi>Luther</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt to Preach.</p>
                  <p>But this was certainly a very poor ſhift:</p>
                  <p>For, Firſt, By ſuch Numeral Hitts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certain can be concluded by any Wiſe Man, as hath appeared by many Examples in former ages, from the ſucceſs of things.</p>
                  <p>But, Secondly, Grant it a prophetical ſpeech concerning <hi>Luther;</hi> the exultation and gratulation of the Celeſtial Spirits for the Preaching of <hi>Luther,</hi> need not to be ſignified thereby (as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> would have it;) but rather the blindneſs of <hi>Luther,</hi> and all that are of his <hi>Sect;</hi> as in the 6th of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> where the Seraphins in like manner cry, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of Hoſts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory,</hi> (from which place, theſe Verſicles are put in the Hymn,) is deſigned the excecation or blindneſs of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44335:51"/>Jews, as by the ſequel it is gathered: For God is provoked at the view of his Holineſs (which abominates all Sin) to execute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and juſt Judgment upon ſo great Wickedneſs and Impiety. In like manner, <hi>they ſhall cry for Vengeance at the end of the World,</hi> Apoc. 4.8. To conclude, if we write theſe Names (according to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> manner) by <hi>m</hi> and not by <hi>n;</hi> that is, <hi>Cherubim</hi> and <hi>Seraphim,</hi> as they ought to be written; ſo the <hi>Number</hi> will riſe to 3157. which being ended, the <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims</hi> will ſtill cry, <hi>Holy, holy, holy;</hi> but this <hi>Clamour</hi> will not be for joy of the ſucceſs of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Goſpel, but an approbation of his juſt puniſhment, whereby he and all his Aſſociates ſhall be tormented to all Eternity.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth Reaſon from a want of Miracles.</head>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Miracles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note>THeſe new Religions with the Authors of them, are very much to be ſuſpected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were introduc'd without Miracles or Signs from God: For theſe were chiefly neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That ſo they might ſhew themſelves to be no Impoſtors, but true Paſtors ſent by Almighty God, and to convince the World they ought to be received. For, ſince it is manifeſt in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that in the later days, many falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, bragging to be ſent from God, therefore our Lord gave us a ſpecial warning of them, not to give ear to them, without infallible proofs of their Miſſion, which cannot be but by Signs and Tokens from God; as are Miracles, Prediction of things to come, Revelation of things hid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for, ſince theſe things are above the power of Creatures, 'tis plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration they are of God: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are like <hi>Patents</hi> ſigned with God's Great Seal, in proof of their Miſſion from him.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that as many as were ever ſent immediately from God, to teach the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44335:52"/>people, were impowered to work Miracles, or ſupernatural Signs, to prove the verity of their Miſſion. So <hi>Moſes</hi> being about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and give them a Law, came with authority to do prodigious Miracles, and he himſelf did innumerable, or God alſo about him, who ſo often appeared to him in a viſible ſhape. So all their <hi>Prophets</hi> proved the truth of the Miſſion by Miracles, or revealing of Secrets. The ſame did <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, Lord of the Prophets; who although 'twas demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that it evidently appeared by the teſtimony of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> yet preſently at the beginning of his Preaching, he ſhewed that he was ſent by his Father for the Salvation of Mankind, by many Miracles; and ſaid to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> (that out of hatred, would not give credit to him) if they would not believe him for his own ſake, at leaſt they ſhould believe him, being convinced by the greatneſs of his Works. In like manner, all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> proved the legality of their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miracles. To conclude, ſo did the firſt <hi>Doctors</hi> of divers <hi>Nations,</hi> which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from <hi>Paganiſm</hi> to our Faith. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince their new Prophets ſay, that they were immediately ſent from God, if they do not confirm it by Miracles, or ſupernatural ſigns (as all others have done, whom God
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44335:52"/>immediately ſent) they ought not to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, or believed.</p>
                  <p>Nor does it avail any thing to ſay, that St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did no Miracles, becauſe God work'd many Wonders, and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things <hi>about</hi> him, whereby his <hi>Miſſion</hi> was ſufficiently manifeſt. Alſo his Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Life, and Sanctity of Manners, was no ſmall Miracle. Therefore no body could doubt, but that God ſent him.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Miracles were abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prove them to be ſent, not only as Converters of Manners, but alſo as Reformers and Correctors of all Religion to re-edifie the Church lapſed, to raiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Kingdom of Chriſt extinct, and to make all things new. How great Miracles had been neceſſary for them whereby to convince the World, that they were bound to believe ſuch Wonders and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, and to receive them for ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers? If they had raiſed a thouſand from the dead, and cured a hundred thouſand lame, blind, and ſick of the Palſie, it had been ſcarce enough to make one believe ſo great a matter. Firſt, Becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Though we, or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be Anathema,</hi> that is, accurſed, <hi>Gall.</hi> 1.8. And repeating the ſame again for greater confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the matter, he adds, as I ſaid
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44335:53"/>before, ſo ſay I now again, <hi>If any one preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that you have received, let him be Anathama, Gal.</hi> 1.9. If we ought not to believe an <hi>Angel</hi> from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, preaching any thing contrary to the received Doctrine of Faith; how many and great Miracles were requiſite to be ſhewed by a mortal Man, that preaches contrary to the approved Faith, before he is to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly believed; as, that Chriſt's Church is utterly fallen, that Idolatry hath got into it, and extinguiſhed the Faith, that all are in the ſtate of Damnation, that the chiefeſt points of Religion are to be reformed, and that God ſent <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> to make this Reformation. Was it not fit, that all the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſhould have been revived by this Reformer? Again, becauſe the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> (which now ſtoriſhes) has been above a thouſand years in poſſeſſion (as our Adverſaries confeſs) and eſteemed over all the World for the true Religion of Chriſt, and they that fell from it, were counted <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great and evident Miracles, to make it appear a wicked and unjuſt poſſeſſion, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lawful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44335:53"/>not deſert the <hi>Catholick Religion.</hi> I add far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> in all thoſe Ages, was famous for the Glory of Miracles, Wiſdom, and Sanctity of the Profeſſors, and even now is. Therefore there is need of many greater and more renowned Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be ſhewed, before ſhe can be lawfully diſpoſſeſsed, caſt down and rejected; alſo of greater Wiſdom and Piety (and that by publick Fame) in the followers of theſe new Religions, than were ever in the Profeſsors of the <hi>Catholick Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, When the Religion of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> was to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and to paſs from the <hi>Shadow</hi> to the <hi>Truth,</hi> from the <hi>Type</hi> to the <hi>Exemplar,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lord could clearly out of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> convince that this change was to be made, and that God ſent him for this purpoſe, yet he was pleaſed to confirm the ſame with many and great Miracles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to take away all occaſion of cavilling and back-ſliding. How many Miracles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall we think needful, when a change is attemted to be made of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> expreſly declare ſhall never be changed, but that God will be with it to the end of the World, and the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt it? Who can prudently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (without great Miracles) a thing ſo

By this it is plain, that we deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly require Miracles of them; and that they deal with us moſt injuriouſly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly, when they command us to believe them (in matters of ſo great weight) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Miracles,</hi> and unleſs we do believe them, to perſecute us grievouſly.</p>

What wonder is it, if heavy things (by removing the impediments) fall downwards; and Rivers (by taking away their dams) run ſpeedily to the Sea? Our depraved and corrupt nature is very prone to a licentious life, which it finds in theſe new Religions: Therefore ſo many profeſs them, not becauſe they are convinc'd (by force of Reaſon) to believe that they are more holy, but becauſe they find in them, that liberty which they covet and ſeek after, and can now enjoy the ſame (without any fear) under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of an honeſt and pious Religion.</p>

                  <p>THE Fifth Reaſon: Becauſe theſe New Religions were introduced by Men of Evil Life, and noted Infamy, Pride, Envy, Malice, and Detraction, having not the leaſt ſhew of an Apoſtolical Spirit in them: For, as to <hi>Luther</hi>'s Life, we know, that he was a profeſſed <hi>Friar,</hi> and <hi>Prieſt,</hi> about fifteen years, and therefore ſtrictly bound by a double Vow of Continency. We know alſo, that this Man forſaking his Monaſtery, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and Profeſſion, returned to a Secular Life; and ſeducing a profeſſed Nun out of her Monaſtery, married her, and lived daily with her; whereby (in the opinion of the whole World) he committed a double Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, and that as many times as he uſed the act of Matrimony. What way of living could be more ſcandalous? We know, that he was ſo addicted to Gluttonny and Luſt, as frequently in his Banquettings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potations he would ſay, <hi>That the uſe of a Woman was more neceſsary than to eat, drink,</hi>

                     <hi>Hierome Bolſecus, Julius Brigerus,</hi> and others, deſcribe <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Life to be full of the worſt of Crimes; as falſe Witneſs, or Perjury, Murders, Thefts, beſtial Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many other Authors write the ſame things, which I never ſaw yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</p>
                  <p>But touching <hi>Luther</hi>'s infamy, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by the Fact aforeſaid, and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the whole World; when being a Religious Man profeſſed, and a Prieſt, he preſumed to Marry a profeſſed Nun; for this raiſes a ſcandal in the judgment of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; for if in the Civil Law, he is become infamous, that is taken in Adultery, how much more he that contracts a double ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Marriage? For Spiritual Adultery committed againſt Chriſt, is much more horrible and filthy, than carnal Adultery of Husband or Wife.</p>
                  <p>And as to the infamy of <hi>Calvin,</hi> It appears out of the Judicial Acts at <hi>Noyon,</hi>

                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:44335:56"/>Concerning <hi>Luther</hi>'s Pride and ſlander, it is manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe his whole Doctrine took its beginning from it: For when certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences were to be publiſhed in <hi>Germany,</hi> this Office was given to to the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> which had often been granted before to the <hi>Auguſtine Friars,</hi> whereof <hi>Luther</hi> was one. This <hi>Luther</hi> took ſo extreamly in dudgeon, and ſo diſdainfully to Heart, that firſt of all he began to diſclaim againſt Indulgences, and being reprehended for the ſame, by degrees he alledged many and greater things againſt the Pope's Authority, and other points of Faith; and thereby raiſed great Commotions and Troubles in <hi>Germany;</hi> as <hi>John Coclaeus</hi> (a Spectator of all theſe things) writes at large in the Acts of <hi>Luther, Anno Dom.</hi> 1517. This Pride and Indignation is the very Fountain and Origin of all <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine; without it, <hi>Luther</hi>'s Religion had not been, nor many others, of which this is the Parent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Luther,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Citizens of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> ſays, <hi>He would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly deny the Real Preſence of Chriſt in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, on purpoſe to prejudice the Papacy, were not the Scriptures ſo clear to the contrary.</hi>

                  <p>From whence you may clearly ſee, by what Spirit he was moved. What can be compared to ſo great Fury and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</p>
                  <p>Alſo, in his Book againſt the <hi>King of England,</hi> he writes, <hi>That Kings, Princes, and Biſhops are not worthy to unty his Shooes, and that he will be taken for a Holy Man in ſpight of their Teeth.</hi> In the ſame place he ſays, <hi>That he cares not a Fig for a thouſand</hi> Cyprians, <hi>and a thouſand</hi> Auguſtines; alſo he calls Chriſtian Princes, Kings, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors; <hi>Tyrants, Block-heads, Aſses, Fools, Wild Beaſts, Hang-men, Nitts, Bubbles,</hi> the <hi>Enemies</hi> of God, moſt <hi>wicked Knaves,</hi> and makes many ſcurrilous Songs on them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In his Letters and ſmaller Works alſo, he publiſhes his own Praiſes, Dignities, and Merits in the Church, under ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited Name, as <hi>Bolſecus</hi> and others tell us. Many more things of this Nature I might inſtance, as well againſt theſe and other Authors and Defenders of the New Religions of this Age; but I meddle with them againſt my Will.

                  <p>Who now that ſeriouſly conſiders theſe things can be induced to believe, that God
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44335:58"/>ſhould make ſuch Men the Reformers of his Church, that were ſo infamous, ambitious, proud, paſſionate, envious, of ſuch ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous language and vicious lives, in the judgment of the World?

They were wonderful for their humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, contempt of the World, poſſeſſions and pleaſures of this Life; wonderful for Charity towards their Neighbour, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and modeſty in their Words. The like manners we behold in all thoſe which God made his Inſtruments for the Converſion of Nations, or to reform the lives of Chriſtians: for example, in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in St. <hi>Boniface</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> in St. <hi>Adelbert,</hi> St. <hi>Otho,</hi> St. <hi>Willebrord,</hi> St. <hi>Eligius,</hi> and others of other Nations; in St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> St. <hi>Romuald,</hi> St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> St. <hi>Francis,</hi> &amp;c. by whoſe good Example, and Holy Doctrine, many were excited to a contempt of earthly things, and love of heavenly.</p>

                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:44335:58"/>If now, for the Converſion of manners in ſome People, God made uſe of ſuch Men, whoſe lives bred admiration in the World, and yet were not ſent immediately by God, but received their <hi>Miſſion</hi> in an ordinary way from the Chief Biſhop, the <hi>Pope,</hi> What kind of Men (I pray) ought they to have been, who were immediately ſent by God, and that to reform the chief Principles of Religion; yea, to repair the whole Church and Kingdom of Chriſt fallen to ruine? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the ſanctity and excellency, all the Vertues and Spiritual Gifts, which were in St. <hi>Jahn Baptiſt,</hi> and all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted together in one, had been infuſed into them; yet all this had ſcarce been enough to gain them a ſufficient <hi>Authority,</hi> for ſo great an enterprize.</p>

                  <head>The Sixth Seaſon from their Errors, and inconſtancy of Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>THe ſixth Reaſon: Becauſe the Authors of theſe Religions have manifeſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and are very unconſtant in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; which is a clear ſign they had not the infallible direction of the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore were not immediately ſent from God, nor to be credited.</p>
                  <p>For, as many as ever God ſent to inſtruct the People, were by him ſo guided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, that in their Preaching and Writings, they could not be deceived. Hence it is, that no Error in the leaſt, could ever be found in the Doctrine of the Prophets and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; which our Lord alſo inſinuates, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'One jot or one title ſhall not paſs from 'the Law, till all be fulfilled, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18. The ſame more at large teaches St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his Epiſtle to St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>If in any part of Holy Scripture, there were found but one lye, it would totally deſtroy the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that Writer: For he that is deceived in one thing, may be likewiſe deceived in another, and therefore we cannot firmly, and ſurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him.</hi> The ſame <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in many places, whoſe words are theſe. <hi>If I ſhould be falſe, and ſo groſly fooliſh as to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44335:60"/>be once cateh'd in a lye, preſently all my Doctrine, Honour, and Credit would fall to the ground, and be utterly ruin'd: Every one would count me a moſt wicked and infamous Raſcal, and that juſtly:</hi> And in another place he ſays, <hi>He that once tells a lye, for certain God never ſent him, and is to be ſuſpected and doubted in all he ſays;</hi> the which he inculcates in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other places of his Works. Yea, our Lord himſelf, in the <hi>Holy Seriptures,</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us this ſign and mark, that if we can diſcern a <hi>Prophet</hi> to utter any thing falſe, we may know, for certain, that God never ſent him.</p>
                  <p>Upon this ſure and firm foundation, I frame this argument. Whoſoever errs but in one thing in his Doctrine, that Perſon is not ſent from God; but <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> (in their Doctrine) erred in many things; therefore 'tis certain that God never ſent them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> has been already ſuciffiently proved, as our Adverſaries themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. The <hi>Minor</hi> I ſhall prove. And to omit thoſe things which they falſly impoſe upon <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and which they falſly affirm in our Doctrine to be new, and unknown to the ancient Fathers, and to paſs by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> and <hi>Chronological</hi> Errors, I ſhall inſtance only two of great moment, common to them both. The Firſt ſays, <hi>That Man has no</hi> Free-will, <hi>but all things
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44335:60"/>happen by an inevitable or unavoidable</hi> neceſſity. The other, <hi>That God is as well the</hi> Author <hi>and Forcer of our</hi> Evil <hi>Works, as of our Good Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That theſe are moſt groſs and pernicious Errors it is manifeſt; becauſe they deſtroy all Government, all Exhortations, all Laws and Precepts, and all Judgments and Tribunals: For all theſe things are in vain, if there is no <hi>Free will;</hi> all puniſhment for Offences would likewiſe be unjuſt; for that which is not ftee and voluntary, and which God forces us to do, deſerves no puniſhment, Laſtly, they take away Hell, and all penalty of the Life to come. Moreover, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a Liberty to commit all manner of Sins, as above in the Second Conſideration it is declared.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Tenets have occ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned many to turn from <hi>Calviniſm,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Flores Cal. pag. <hi>69.</hi>
                     </note> to be <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts:</hi> For it is better to have no <hi>God</hi> at all, than to eſteem him the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Enforcer</hi> of all <hi>Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now their inconſtancy of Doctrine (even in the greateſt and weightieſt matters) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.

Luther.</note> Thirty ſix Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and printed them when <hi>Luther</hi> was living, to his great ſhame and confuſion, and the diminution of his Authority. And of Communion under both kinds, <hi>Cochlaeus</hi> has noted ſeven contradictory Articles. In fine, <hi>Cochlaeus</hi>'s whole Book (called <hi>Lutherus Septiceps</hi>) contains nothing elſe but <hi>Luther</hi>'s Contradictions and contrary Opinions, in almoſt all his controverted Articles, in the expreſs Words of <hi>Luther.</hi> Now, in every contradiction, of neceſſity one part muſt be falſe.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Calvin, Coccius</hi> relates Twenty four Contradictions of his, in his very own Words: It is enough for me to ſet down two of them: <hi>Touching God's Omnipotency,</hi> in one place he ſays, <hi>nothing is impoſſible to the Word of God,</hi> Luk. 1. And in another place he ſays, <hi>That Dream of an Abſolute Power in God</hi> (which the School Doctors have introduced) <hi>is an execrable Blaſphemy, Pſa.</hi> 23. Again, <hi>I abhor this Doctrine in which the Papiſt Divines pleaſe themſelves, feigning
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44335:61"/>in God a certain Abſolute Power.</hi> Of Chriſt's Godhead, in one place he writes, <hi>That Chriſt is true God, of the ſame Eſsence with his Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Predeſtin.</note> 1 Joh. 5.1. In another place he ſays, <hi>The Name of God, by way of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contr. Gentil. refutat. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>belongs to the Father only; that he only and properly is the Creator of Heaven and Earth;</hi> ay, <hi>and that Son (according to his Godhead) is ſubject to the Father.</hi> Again, <hi>That it is a hard and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper expreſſion of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Creed: God of God, Light of Light.</hi> In his Second Epiſtle to the <hi>Polanders,</hi> he affirms, <hi>That Chriſt (according to his Divine Nature) is leſs than the Father.</hi> Lo, whither he tumbles by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Noveliſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being poſitive and clear in their own Writings, what Wiſe Man can be induced to believe, that God ſent them to reform the <hi>Church?</hi> For how ſhall they raiſe the fallen <hi>Church,</hi> when they ſo vilely deſtroy their own Doctrine? Who have ſo little Learning, or Prudence, and circumſpection, as not to avoid contradictions in matters of the greateſt moment? Certainly, whoſoever contradicts himſelf, and preſently pulls down what he hath newly erected, 'tis clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Noon-day, that he ſpeaks not by the Spirit of God. <hi>For if I build again the things which I deſtroyed</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>I make
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44335:62"/>my ſelf a Prevaricator,</hi> Gal. 2.18. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God cannot be contrary to himſelf, cannot deny himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Take notice likewiſe, That although in many things they contradict themſelves, and overthrow their own Principles, yet they have Face and Impudence to ſay, that they are certain their Doctrine is true, and the very Doctrine of Chriſt. For thus <hi>Luther</hi> writes, <hi>I am certain I received my Doctrine from Heaven.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cont. Reg. Aug.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>I am certain that my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is not mine, but Chriſt's.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he ſays, <hi>that he is ſo abſolutely ſure,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cont. Stat. &amp; Eccleſ.</note> 
                     <hi>that he will have no Body to be Judge of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; no, not the Angels; and that none can be ſaved, who believes not his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner, <hi>Calvin</hi> oftentimes ſays, <hi>That he is a Prophet; that he can deceive none, unleſs God deceive him;</hi> as I have ſhewed in the <hi>Fifth Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereby 'tis a clear demonſtration, that not only they ſpeak not by the Spirit of God (having ſuch open and manifeſt Errours and Contradictions,) but alſo are to be look'd upon as Impoſtors, who deceive the People: For he that ſays he is certain, that his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (in which are many Errours and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions) is of God, may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44335:62"/>not to deal fairly and ſincerely, but to ſpeak againſt his own Conſcience, and ſo to impoſe upon the People. 'Tis manifeſt, that ſuch a one hath no Internal Illumination from God, to make him certain of the Truth of his Doctrine, by the Teſtimony of God: For God cannot teſtifie or reveal Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. With what Face therefore, can they ſo impudently affirm, that they are ſure their Doctrine is of God, or Chriſt's Doctrine? Therefore they deal not honeſtly and ſincerely, but endeavour to blind the World.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will confeſs that they erred (now and then) at the beginning, when they had not yet fully received the Spirit of God; but afterwards they did not err, nor change their Opinions. But this has no colour of Truth at all: For all thoſe who ever have been immediately ſent by God to teach the People, have preſently (at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their <hi>Miſſion</hi>) had the infallible aſſiſtance and direction of God, ſo that they could never, in the leaſt, err in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. As 'tis manifeſt by the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Nay, there was greateſt need of this direction in the begiuning, becauſe then chiefly all things were to be diſcuſſed, the Teachers and their Doctrine to be examin'd, that ſo they might gain Authority, and be believed: For if they had been catch'd in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44335:63"/>any Errour or Contradiction at firſt, all their Authority would have fallen to the ground, and periſhed.</p>
                  <p>In the like caſe, if <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> were ſent by God to reform the Church, there was great need, that preſently, at the beginning, their Doctrine ſhould be ſolid and ſound, free from all Contradiction and Errour, leaſt they might juſtly be rejected as Impoſtors.</p>
                  <p>Then again, I ask, when (at length) did they obtain this plenitude or fulneſs of the Spirit, ſo as never to err any more? How could that appear to the World, that Men may know they are to be credited at laſt, though they were not at firſt: For, unleſs this can be ſhew'd, we may rightly preſume, that they may erre in their future, who manifeſtly have erred in their former Writings.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, that they were various in their Life, that they changed and mended their Principles, and in divers little Books, which they publiſhed, (and ſometimes in one and the ſame Book) they writ ſeveral contradictions, it is apparent by thoſe few things afore-mentioned, and by many more, which <hi>Cochlaeus, Coccius,</hi> and others have recorded in their own words. For the longer they ſtood out in oppoſition to the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44335:63"/>
                     <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> more invective and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they became againſt it; and what more mildly they alledged at firſt, afterward they made worſe, or changed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

                  <head>The Seventh Reaſon, from tht malicious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and Frauds they make uſe of.</head>
                  <p>THat Religion is to be ſuſpected, whoſe Authors and Defenders uſe malicious Deceits, Frauds, and Lies to propagate it: For the true Religion wants no ſuch helps, but only the falſe; which being deſtitute of true and ſolid Reaſons, muſt neceſſarily place its hope and confidence in a Lye.</p>
                  <p>But the Authors and Propagators of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Religion uſed many Frauds and Lies to encreaſe their Sect, therefore it is worthily to be ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>That they uſed moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Frauds and Deceits,<note place="margin">Falſe Tenets impoſed upon Catholicks.</note> is manifeſt; becauſe they impoſed upon Catholicks many things falſely, that ſo they might eaſier confute them, and make their Religion ſcandalous; as to ſay, <hi>That Papiſts worſhip Images, Stocks, and Stones, as the Heathens did their Idols;</hi> ſo whatſoever there is in Scripture againſt the worſhip of Idols, the ſame they alledge againſt our veneration of Holy Images; wherein they deal not ſincerely and candidly but very fraudulently and falſely; for they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44335:64"/>know (or may eaſily know if they will) that the Images of Saints are never adored in the Church, as Gods, or with that adoration which is due to God only; as the Heathens worſhipped their Idols; nor in that manner do they reverence Images, for any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in them, but ſo as it may paſs to the Prototype, or to the Saints reigning with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For the external mark of adoration which is made before an Image, is a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Original, or that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the Image. As to erect the King's Statue, or to ſtand bare before it, is no Honour to the Statue, but is an honour and reverence give to the King.</p>
                  <p>That the Honour which we exhibit to Saints, is not <hi>Cultus Latriae,</hi> or the Honour due and proper to God only, is manifeſt; becauſe we worſhip not any Saint, as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord and Creator of all things, but only Honour them as his Friends, who is the Supreme Lord and Creator of all things. For we ſo highly eſteem God, as to repute his Friends (whom he hath ſo highly exalted) worthy of Honour likewiſe; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly can be no injury to God, but rather to God's greater Honour and Glory; as 'tis more Honour to the King whoſe Courtiers are honoured (out of love and reſpect to the King) becauſe they are his Domeſticks, Miniſters, and Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mention
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44335:65"/>theſe things, becauſe many ignorant People ſtumble at them.</p>
                  <p>Again, they cry out againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> for worſhipping Bread as God; and therefore <hi>Calvin</hi> frequently calls Catholicks, <hi>Bread-worſhippers,</hi> or Worſhippers of Breaden-Gods. But here alſo they uſe a grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to beguile the People; for they know well enough, that Catholicks believe there remains no ſubſtance of Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt; but that the Body and Blood of Chriſt, together with his Soul and Divinity, is there truly, really, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially (under the Accidents of Bread and Wine,) and ſo they do not adore the Bread and Wine, but Chriſt there totally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>Then again they alledge, that Papiſts put not their confidence in Chriſt's Merits, but in their own, and in the Merits of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Again, That Papiſts teach, that Man is not juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt, but by their own Merits and Good Works, and the like; which are nothing elſe but meer Shams and Lies invented to make the Catholick Religion odious, and gull the People.</p>
                  <p>I could bring here above an hundred Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets falſely impoſed upon the whole Church, or the Catholick Doctors, if need were.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44335:65"/>Who can ſay now the Spirit of Chriſt was in ſuch Men, or that they proceeded ſincerely in this affair, or were willing to eſtabliſh the Truth?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They do not only impoſe falſe Tenets on us, but alſo falſe Accuſations and Calumnies; eſpecially, on thoſe whom they imagine will moſt hinder their ſucceſs; namely, Slaughters, Maſſacres, Treaſons againſt Princes, and all kinds of Villany. Good God, how many Libels were formerly publiſhed by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and now yearly are ſpread amongſt the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, wherein they charge Religious Men with moſt horrible and dreadful Crimes, though never ſo innocent? But theſe deceits have been eaſily diſcovered: For partly in the publick Letters of the Magiſtrates, the innocency of theſe Religious Men is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, and the falſity of their Accuſers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; and partly out of the narration it ſelf, and by the circumſtances thereof they were clearly refuted; for in ſome of their Libels there are above fifty manifeſt Lies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; in others twelve, fifteen, twenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For Hatred or Malice is a thing ſo raging, inveterate, and blind, that it cares not what miſchief it invents (though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any probability of Truth in the matter) ſo it may do harm; but this harm is only
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44335:66"/>momentary, and ſoon after the impudence of the Slander is manifeſted, it turns to the greater commendation of them that ſuffer it patiently, and greater ſhame and deteſtation of thoſe that contrived it.</p>
                  <p>Finally, They uſe falſe dealing in confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Principles; as by adding, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, changing, or omitting ſomething of Scripture, and Sayings of the Fathers; or by letting paſs the clear places of Scripture, and citing ſome obſcure places to favour their Doctrine: For <hi>Luther,</hi> to eſtabliſh his Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith only; where the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>we account a Man to be juſtified by Faith,</hi> adds <hi>only;</hi>) and being asked, why he did ſo? he anſwered in theſe Words,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum de Verbo Sola.</note> 
                     <hi>If any Papiſt is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at this, that I ſhould add to the Text the Word</hi> only, <hi>tell him from me, that a Papiſt and an Aſs is all one; ſo I will have it, ſo I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; my Will ſtands for Reaſon and Law.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:44335:66"/>The ſaid <hi>Luther</hi> tranſlating that ſaying of St. <hi>Peter, Wherefore Brethren, labour the more, that by Good Works, you may make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. leaves out theſe Words, <hi>by Good Works;</hi> which are clear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Tenet, that Good Works are not profitable to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, <hi>Vow and pay to the Lord your God;</hi> upon which Words <hi>Luther</hi> makes this Gloſs in the Margent, containing a tripple Fraud: <hi>Vow, that God ſhall be your God, which is according to the Firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make no Vows to the Saints, or other Vows.</hi> It is written in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> 31.10. <hi>who can find a valiant Woman?

                  <p>The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> therefore ſay, that all the Fathers and Doctors, and all the General Councils wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Spirit to underſtand the Scriptures; the ſame Holy Spirit they affirm the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> wanted, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only poſſeſs him, that God has given him only to the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and therefore to themſelves its manifeſt, that whatſoever they teach is the pure word of God.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay the ſame thing of the Councils and Pathers, and alſo of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinïſts</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that they all want the Spirit of God, which is given only to themſelves; and ſo, ſay they, it is clear that what we teach is the plain pure word of God.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> do the ſame, challenging to themſelves the ſaid Holy Spirit, and denying him to all others.</p>
                  <p>But how abſurd are all theſe things, and how diſtant from all reaſon? How incredible is it that all the Catholick Doctors and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould lack the Spirit of underſtanding
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44335:69"/>the Scriptures, and that this Spirit ſhould be granted only to the <hi>Calviniſts, Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſts?</hi> How vain and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous is it for every Sect to claim this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to their own followers, and without any other proof, than to ſay, <hi>It is manifeſt and clear to him that has the Spirit; but not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and clear to him that has not the Spirit.</hi> Is not this to walk in a Circle, and beg the Principle, and reſolve all Controverſie into that which is chiefly obſcure and can be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to none? For how ſhall I know that you have the Spirit? When ever did the Doctors of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church (in this manner) prove their Tenets? For every proof or provation ought to be drawn from that which is more manifeſt to the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and eaſier granted by him. But this probation (upon which is founded all their Principles) proceeds from what is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and depends only upon the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a private Man, who is a Party and Accuſer in the Cauſe: for you cannot prove to me, that you have this Holy Spirit, but by your own Teſtimony alone, which is to bear Witneſs of your ſelf: <hi>But he that gives Teſtimony of himſelf, his teſtimony is not true: Joh.</hi> 8.13. That is, is not to be eſteemed true, unleſs by ſome other way he can prove it: For Example, Theſe <hi>Calviniſts</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove (by other ways) that they have
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44335:70"/>this private Spirit, but would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, upon their bare word and naked aſſertion, whereby they affirm to know it ſecretly. Therefore, there is no reaſon why they ſhould be credited; but rather there is great reaſon, why all ſhould be disbelieved: for the Spirit of God cannot be contrary to it ſelf; but they are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to themſelves, and others alſo: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not guided by the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>And hereunto, and this alſo pertaining to their fraud, and deceitful Machinations and Contrivances, they revolted from the Antient Faith (which had flouriſhed ſo many Ages) and they embraced theſe New Religions. Their Princes (according to the cuſtom of the Church, received from the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great) would compel them to return to the Antient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (which ſometimes they profeſſed) and forſake their Novelties: For which cauſe they rail againſt Catholick Princes, and accuſe them of Tyranny, call them Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Goſpel, and over all the World raiſe envy againſt them, as thoſe that would do violence to their Conſciences, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Eternal Salvation. And laſtly, under colour of this Liberty, they raiſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and wage War againſt them: But when themſelves (God permitting it for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44335:70"/>our ſins) get poſſeſſion of our Goods or Eſtates, they grant no Liberty to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, but raiſe bitter perſecutions againſt them, and force them (with divers Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Confiſcation of their Goods) to deſert their Ancient Religion, and embrace the New, which they never learned, which never had any Name, but of their Sect, which they owe nothing unto, which they never ſaw confirmed by any rational Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but on the contrary, condemned by the Church (in all the Chriſtian World) with the greateſt and moſt-weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Is this to deal ſincerely, candidly, and equitably? Is not this the Society of Lyons, whoſe Right conſiſts in their Power and Strength, who make and unmake Laws for their Intereſt? And what Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Conſcience can be compared to this?</p>
                  <p>In the Church, none are ever compelled to the Catholick Faith, but thoſe who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly profeſſed it; nor they neither, but after a lawful and full Proof and Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which the Deſerters cannot An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. But theſe New Reformers compel thoſe that never profeſſed their Novelties, and before they have convinced them of Errour. In which thing, they act againſt their own Doctrine. <hi>For they teach, that Man has no Free-will, but all things are done
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44335:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>by the Divine impulſe and decree, which none can reſist, and that God infuſeth Faith into his Elect only.</hi> By what Law then do they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Catholicks to believe them, ſince it is not in their power? Again, ſince the whole cauſe of believing (according to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees) is reduced to the Teſtimony of the private Spirit, they do very unjuſtly in forcing Catholicks to believe them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Teſtimony of the private Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; but alſo againſt the Teſtimony of the publick Spirit of the Univerſal Church. For it is certain (out of the Scriptures) that the Church is governed by the Spirit of God, and therefore cannot err; but yet, this is in no manner certain of private Men.</p>

                  <p>If all our Good Works are truly Sins, Filthineſs, and Pollution, which incur the Wrath of God, who ſees not that it is much better to abſtain from them, than to do them?

We muſt abſtain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from <hi>Alms,</hi> and other works of Mercy; nay, from all <hi>Prayer</hi> too; becauſe all theſe

                  <p>And it avails nothing, what they ſay afterwards;<note place="margin">Whether Good Works are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as ſigns of Faith.</note> that God requires Good Works in teſtimony of their Faith, or as the ſigns of Faith: For this they ſay, leaſt the People ſhould utterly renounce all Good Works.

                  <head>The Ninth Reaſon, from the licentiouſneſs of Life, which they allow.</head>
                  <p>THoſe Religions are not to be Father'd upon Chriſt, which totally expel the fear of God from the Minds of Men, and ſet open the broad Gate to all manner of ſin and impurity of Life: For every where the Scripture teaches the fear of God, nor is there any thing which it more repeats and commends, ſince from this all honeſty of Life chiefly depends. But the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Religion drive all fear of God from the minds of Men, and open the Gate of Liberty to all Sin and Profaneſs, as much as Atheiſm. Therefore they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not from Chriſt the Author.</p>
                  <p>That theſe Religions do this, and that, four ſeveral ways has already been clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed above in the Second Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſame I now briefly ſhew again, by theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Religion reaches, <hi>That the Decalogue (or Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments belong no more to the Faithful in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44335:76"/>Chriſt, than the Ceremonial and Judaical Laws.</hi> For thus <hi>Luther</hi> writes in a Sermon on <hi>Moſes:</hi> 
                     <q>From the Text it plainly appears, that the Ten Commandments pertain nothing to us; for the Lord did not lead us cut of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but only the <hi>Jews. Moſes</hi> is not obſerved in the New Teſtament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If I ſhould keep him in any one Article, I ſhould oblige my ſelf to perform his whole Law.</q> The ſame he teaches more at large in <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt. ad Gal</hi> and in <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Exod.</hi> If we are no more bound to keep the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, than the Ceremonial Laws (as he plainly teaches in <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt. ad Gal.</hi>) Therefore as I am not bound to obſerve the Ceremonial Law; (for example, to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Fleſh, to eat the Paſchal Lamb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to keep the Sabbath (which was Satturday a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews;) ſo neither the Moral, or Ten Commandments. If I am now freed from the Commandments, what may I not do? I may in outward ſhew worſhip Idols, diſobey my Parents and the Magiſtrates, commit Murder, Adultery, Theft, bear Falſe-witneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which are forbidden by the Decalogue) as I may do things which are repugnant to the Ceremonial Law.</p>
                  <p>And although <hi>Calvin</hi> does not ſo plainly teach the ſame Doctrine of the Decalogue, yet occurately he inſinuates it enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:44335:76"/>Firſt, Becauſe he teaches, <hi>That God's Law is</hi> impoſſible <hi>to be kept, even by the Saints.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> Inſtit. c. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> If it be impoſſible, then it is not obligatory; for no Body is obliged to impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities: Never any Tyrant bound his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to do things impoſſible, and ſhall God do it? Such barbarous cruelty be far from him. Therefore, when the Decalogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be impoſſible, it ceaſes to oblige, and belongs nothing at all to us. Moreover, becauſe <hi>Calvin</hi> teaches, that all our Good Works are Corruption, Filth and Sin in the ſight of God; but no Body can be obliged to ſin; therefore we are not obliged, ſo much as to endeavour to fulfil any part of the Commandments. I might confirm the ſame with many other Reaſons, but theſe are ſufficient; whereby it is manifeſt, that even (according to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Opinion) the Ten Commandments belong nothing to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe two Religions make no difference of good and bad works before God, but only before Men; for as the works (which are called bad) have open Malice; ſo to the good works of the Juſt, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute an hidden Malice, becauſe of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Concupiſcence; by reaſon of which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, they will have theſe to be deadly ſins before God. If it be ſo, why ſhould I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44335:77"/>apply my mind to good works (with mortification of Nature and loſs of Goods) than to evil works, whereunto (many times) there is adjoined great pleaſure and profit? For ſince either of them are evil before God, why ſhould I not rather prefer thoſe works, wherein there is ſome temporal pleaſure or advantage, before them that are full of trouble, toil, and loſs?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe each Religion teacheth, that a Man is only juſt before God, by a meer ſpecial Faith, without any good works; and that God imputes no ſin to him, that has this ſpecial Faith.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Luther</hi> teaches in many places, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove rehearſed: By which Doctrine he infers,<note place="margin">L. de liber. Chriſtian. &amp; de Captiv. Babyl.</note> 'That only incredulity is a ſin, and only diſ-believers are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The ſame <hi>Calvin</hi> teaches, when he ſays, 'That all ſins are mortal to Unbelievers, but venial to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: He calls them venial ſins, becauſe they are not imputed to them, but are preſently forgiven and pardoned, as ſoon as they are committed; which Doctrine clearly follows out of that Principle, whereby they decree this ſpecial Faith alone to be the cauſe of Juſtification; that is, that man is juſtified before God, in that he believes ſtedfaſtly,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44335:77"/>that Chriſt has fully ſatisfied for their ſins; for by this Faith, Chriſt's ſatisfaction is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them, and made as it were their own; ſo that by it they are reputed juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, although their Will is not inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed. Therefore, whilſt this Faith remaineth, no ſin can hurt them, becauſe they remain in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which they retain firmly by Faith. Upon this Doctrine there is no reaſon to fear the commiſſion of any ſin: for no puniſhment, no vengeance of God is to be feared, ſince God imputes no guilt to them, by reaſon of Chriſt's ſatisfaction communicated to them by Faith.</p>
                  <p>Can any <hi>Atheiſt</hi> deſire a greater liberty to ſin, and lead as wicked a life as he pleaſes? Certain Presbyterian Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> confeſs this ſufficiently, who, from this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Calvin</hi> (tounhing Juſtification by Faith only) among others, deduce and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend theſe Concluſions.</p>

                  <head>The Tenth Reaſon, from raking up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving old Hereſies.</head>
                  <p>EVery Religion is to be avoided, which conteins Hereſies condemned of old by the Catholick Church, which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken for Hereſies. But theſe New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions contain ſuch Hereſies; yea, they ſeem to be nought elſe, but the very Scum of divers Hereſies, broach'd by ſeveral Arch-Hereticks in former Ages, and of old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Catholick Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to fly them. The Minor is to be proved. Let us conſider then the chiefeſt Tenets of theſe Religions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Both <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> teach, that there is no <hi>Free-will.</hi> And <hi>Luther</hi> in his Thirty ſixth Article affirms this to be the chief Foundation of his Religion: But this was the old Hereſie of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Valentine,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> witneſſeth. <hi>Auguſt. Hereſ.</hi> 46. <hi>Hier. in Prolog. contr. Pelag. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens. l.</hi> 3. <hi>recognit. Concil. Conſt. Seſſ.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:44335:79"/>Secondly, Both teach, That God is the impulſive Cauſe of all Sin, and that all Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs is done by the Divine Decree. This was the old Hereſie of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and <hi>Florinus. Vincen. Liri. Euſeb. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They both teach, That Good Works are not neceſſary to Salvation, but Faith alone is ſufficient. This likewiſe was the old Hereſie of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and of the <hi>Eunomians,</hi> about the year of our Lord 360. <hi>Iraen. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>Auguſt. Hereſ.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They hoth teach, That no Sins (be they never ſo many and great) can hurt them that have Faith; becauſe the Malice of them is not imputed to Believers: Which was formerly the Hereſie of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians,</hi> and of <hi>Baſilides, Carpocratis.</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Irenaeus l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24. <hi>Auguſt. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ.</hi> 54.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Calvin</hi> denies the Real Preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt. This was formerly the Hereſie of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year of our Lord 1051. where you muſt note, Firſt, that although ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately doubted of the matter, before <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius,</hi> and raiſed Queſtions; yet none was ſo bold, as publickly to profeſs the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44335:80"/>ſame. Witneſs <hi>Hugo Lingonenſis, &amp; Aldel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus Brixienſis in Epiſt. ſuis ad Bereng. &amp; Paſchaſius l. de verb. inſtit. hujus Sacram.</hi> So that this was the conſtant Doctrine of the Church (untouched by all Hereticks) till the time of <hi>Berengarius.</hi> And the Opinion of <hi>Berengarius</hi> was (in his Life-time) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Five Councils, and himſelf three times renounced his Opinion, and at length died in the Catholick Faith, very penitent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; who being dead, this Hereſie was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed almoſt 200 years, till the <hi>Lollards</hi> revived it, as <hi>Trithemius</hi> obſerves in his Chron. to the year 1315. The ſame Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie after <hi>Wickliff</hi> held, as 'tis manifeſt in his Third Article: When <hi>Wickliff</hi> died, then this Hereſie died alſo, for about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, till <hi>Zwinglius</hi> revived it, whom <hi>Calvin</hi> and ſome others followed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it manifeſtly appears, that the ſaid Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was always reputed in the Church for a notorious Hereſie. Therefore, either the Church always erred in the chief Article of her Faith (and ſo was never the Church of Chriſt) or this Opinion, which denies the Real Preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, is truly a Hereſie.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Both of them take away all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and will have all things contained in the Scriptures only. This was the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44335:80"/>of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> as appears by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>cont. Maxim. c.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; ult.</hi> Alſo of <hi>Neſtorius, Dioſcurus,</hi> and <hi>Eutyches;</hi> as you may ſee in the Seventh <hi>Synod, Act.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, They both deny the Sacrament of Pennance and Confirmation. The ſame Hereſie the <hi>Novatians</hi> taught of old. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs St. <hi>Cyp.</hi> and <hi>Theodor. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>Heret. Fabul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, They both teach, That the Church conſiſts of the Good only: That at firſt it was viſible; but for many Ages pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; yet all that while to exiſt in them only. This was plainly the Hereſie of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Witneſſeth, <hi>l. de unitati Eccleſiae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, They both deny Prayer for the Dead, Faſts in Lent, or at any other time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This heretofore taught the <hi>Arrians.</hi> Witneſs <hi>Epiphanius, Hereſ.</hi> 75. and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l. de Hereſ. c.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Both of them deny Veneration to Sacred Images of Chriſt and his Saints, and to Holy Relicks, and call it Idolatry. The ſame of old did <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> as St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> witneſſeth; and ſo did the <hi>Iconomachiſts,</hi> witneſs <hi>Zonoras, Cedrinus, Nicephorus, Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomachis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:44335:81"/>Hereby is clearer than the Sun at Noon day, that the Chief Tenets of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Religion, are old Hereſies, long ago condemned by the Church; and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken for Hereſies in the Church. The ſame might be eaſily proved of other Sects. Hence it follows, that theſe New Religions are nothing but the Filth and Scum of old Hereſies formerly condemned. <hi>Vid. Bel. de nov.

                  <p>THeſe New Religions have no certain Rule of Faith, which you may follow. Therefore they are not to be allowed: For Points of Religion ought to be defined, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and immutable.</p>
                  <p>That they have no certain Rule of Faith, whereby can be determined, what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed, and what not, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: Firſt, Becauſe they will not allow the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Church, nor the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>General Councils,</hi> nor of the Ancient <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Church, who were before our Debates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luther</hi> rejects all <hi>Traditions</hi> in the Firſt Chapter to the <hi>Galat.</hi> And <hi>Calvin l.</hi> 4. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit.</hi> And both of them teach.

                  <p>
                     <hi>General Councils,</hi> which have had hitherto in the Church, the higheſt Authority, (for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44335:82"/>they are as the Aſſemblies of Princes and Noblemen in Chriſt's Kingdom,) <hi>Luther</hi> ſo contemns, that whatſoever they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, he would have it all to be ſubject to the judgment of every private Perſon.

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Calvin</hi> inſinuates, ſaying, 'The 'Church ought not to judge what Books are Canonical, and what not, but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the private Spirit. <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>ſ.</hi> 1.24.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as touching the <hi>Fathers: Luther</hi> 'cares not for a thouſand <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines,</hi> 'nor a thouſand <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians.</hi>

                     <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo, in many places, contemns them, and averrs that they erred.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, none of theſe is a Rule of Faith to them,<note place="margin">Whether the Scripture is a ſufficient Rule of Faith.</note> but they ſay, The <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf is their Rule of Faith; for this cannot err: But 'tis eaſie to ſhew, that this Rule is not ſufficient. Firſt, Becauſe by this Rule, we cannot judge of <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf, that it is <hi>Scripture:</hi> So that this Rule is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44335:82"/>to us, which ought to be the moſt certain of all things: For it cannot appear out of Scripture, that this or that Book is truly the Scripture; that it is not ſuppoſititious, or counterfeited by ſome Impoſtor; that this or that Sentence is not perverted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Laſtly, that there is nothing added or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed pertaining to the ſubſtance of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. All this cannot appear out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but is only proved by ſome humane and weak Conjectures, if you exclude the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church; and ſo the whole Foundation of our Faith, will depend upon a few uncertain Conjectures. Then again, the force of Scripture conſiſts not in the ſound of Words, but in the Sence, which is the Life and Soul of Scripture: But there may be a thouſand Controverſies of the Sence, which cannot be decided out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, if you exclude Tradition and Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Fathers, as 'tis manifeſt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: For touching the ſence of theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there is a great diſpute between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ſay with <hi>Calvin,</hi> that the Judge of Scriptures,<note place="margin">Whether the judgment of Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vate Spirit.</note> and the Sence thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the inward Spirit; this is nothing elſe, but to conſtitute the <hi>dictamen</hi> of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44335:83"/>Interior Spirit (that is, the private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every one) to be the chief Rule of Faith: For every one may ſay, that he has the Spirit, and by his inſpiration judges this part to be Holy Scripture, and not that; this to be the right ſence of Scripture, and not that. So a <hi>Lutheran</hi> (according to his Spirit) judges the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James</hi> to be ſtraw, and the <hi>Revelations</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi> to be of doubtful Authority: But a <hi>Calviniſt</hi> (by his Spirit) judges both to be the Word of God. So <hi>Luther</hi> judges by his Spirit, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the falſe Opinion, That there are Four Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels;<note place="margin">In the Prologue of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</note> for the Goſpel of St. <hi>John</hi> is the only true, beautiful, and principal Goſpel, and to be preferred far before the other three. Likewiſe the Epiſtles of <hi>Baul</hi> far excel <hi>Peter</hi>'s. The thee Goſpels of St <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> he would willingly have renounced, becauſe they are clearly for Merits, neceſſity of Good Works, and Obſervation of the Commandments, and commend Chaſtity and Poverty: But ſince he durſt not totally reject them, he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſparage their Authority, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that they were not written by the Spirit of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:44335:83"/>In like manner, <hi>Calvin</hi> (by his Spirit) judges this to be right ſence of theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> That is, This Bread is the Figure of my Body. But <hi>Luther</hi> (according to his Spirit) judges otherwiſe, and ſays theſe Words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> are thus to be underſtood. This Bread is truly my Body. I omit many other ſayings; whereby it is manifeſt, that, according to them, the private Spirit of every one makes a Rule of Faith, or (which is the ſame thing) the Scripture is expounded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every Ones private judgment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That is not to be held a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Rule of Faith, which is equally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, or fitted, to all contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, For all the Sects of this time (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are at Daggers-point about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny principal Tenets) adopt the Scriptures to be their Rule, and fit it for their purpoſe: For the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay, they rely upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſo do the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and likewiſe the <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> nor is it any wonder, becauſe every one receives the Scripture, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common underſtanding of the Church, or expoſition of the Fathers (as Catholicks do,) but according to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every one's private Spirit. So you may eaſily adapt the Scripture for all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. Whence it is plain, that a Rule, thus
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44335:84"/>framed, can be of no moment, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to every one's private judgment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If there ſhould be a Judge that ſhould ſo give ſentence in any Controverſie, that one could not plainly tell, whoſe Cauſe carried it; but both Parties ſhould ſhill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the deciſion of their Cauſe, he would be accounted by all Men a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Judge, ſince no Controverſie can be determined by his ſentence; for after it there is as great debate, for whom the Judge gave ſentence, as about the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference they brought before him. But ſuch a Judge is the Holy Scripture, if you ſet aſide the Expoſition of the Church and the Fathers; for ſo it always gives ſentence, that it cannot plainly appear to either Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſide it favoureth; but both ſtifly affirm, that it ſtands clearly for him. Hence it comes to paſs, that Controverſies never have an end. 'Tis ridiculous therefore to make only the Scripture the Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies: For, in all Controverſies, ſuch a one ought to be made a Judge, ſo as to give ſentence, that all (and chiefly the Parties in diſpute) may clearly ſee, which ſide the Judge is for, or elſe there can be no end of Controverſie. Therefore, they that make only the Scripture their Judge, ſhew plainly that they will have no Judge to decide the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44335:84"/>Cauſe, but their own private judgment. For they do, as if <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Caius</hi> having a Suit at Law, would have no other Judge but the Book of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> with his <hi>Pandects,</hi> ſecluding the Interpretation of the Doctors; and <hi>Titius</hi> for his Right ſhould produce ſome Law, and ſay, that it is clear for his Cauſe; but <hi>Caius</hi> denies it: Likewiſe <hi>Caius</hi> alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another Law, affirming, that it clearly makes for him; but <hi>Titius</hi> denies it; and ſo both Parties depart without deciſion of their Cauſe; would not this be a ridiculous thing, and make all ſay, that neither of them would have their Cauſe decided, ſince both of them would be their own Judge? It is plainly ſo with them, that will have no other Judge but the Scripture: For whoſoever reſerves the Interptetation thereof to his own Spirit, ſhews plainly, that he would not have his Cauſe lawfully decided, but be his own Judge.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Experience it ſelf ſhews how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient this Rule of Faith is: For we ſee, that there is no end of Controverſies amongſt them, even in their chief Points of Faith: For the <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks</hi> in many things extreamly differ at this very time, and condemn one another of Hereſie. The very <hi>Lutherans</hi> diſagree amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in many things alſo from <hi>Luther</hi> their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44335:85"/>Parent and Apoſtle; inſomuch, that at this very time, there are counted Thirteen Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Sects of <hi>Lutherans,</hi> differing by certain Names and Opinions. The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> diſſent amongſt themſelves, chiefly in the Article, of the Head of the Church; for a great part of them aſcribe this Power to the Secular Prince, although ſhe be a Woman; theſe they call <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> Others eſteem this a great Sin and Blaſphemy: theſe they call <hi>Puritans.</hi> The <hi>Fanaticks</hi> diſſent amongſt themſelves in many things, ſo that there is reckoned Fourteen ſeveral Sects of them, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by Names and Opinions.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is come now to that paſs, that when any one thinks to follow this Rule, and depend on it, there are almoſt as many <hi>Hereſies</hi> as <hi>Hereticks:</hi> For many (eſpecially the ignorant ſort) ſay, they care not what <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> teacheth, for that they ſtick to the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and Word of God, wherein there can be no Errour; and ſo they think themſelves very ſecure; for every one interpretes the Scripture according to his Capacity and Judgment. Hence it is, that when they think they have Scripture for their Rule of Faith, inſtead of Scripture, they have only their own Imagination: For what they fancy the Words of Scripture ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, they take for the true ſence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44335:85"/>And thus there are as many different Rules of Faith, as Imaginations of Men.</p>
                  <p>But how comes it to paſs, that every ones imagination ſhould ſeem to be the pure Truth, and right ſence of Scripture? This proceeds partly from a great ſelf-love and ſelf-eſteem; for he that has a high conceit of himſelf, is eaſily perſwaded, that all his own inventions and conceptions of Mind are extraordinary; partly alſo from a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical operation, which inwardly perverts the fancy of Men, that what they apprehend (upon never ſo ſlight a reaſon) preſently they imagine it to be the clear Truth: For where Men (through a wearineſs of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Religion) have an averſion to the Truth, and Itching Ears to Novelties, they are ſuffered (by the juſt Judgment of God) to be deceived of the Devil. Whilſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he operates interiourly in their Sences, they think they are illuminated with the Divine Spirit, and attribute to this Spirit, their whole judgment touching points of Faith. Hence it is, that the apprehenſion or judgment of every Sect, and almoſt of every private Man, ſeems to be the pure Word of God, nor do they regard any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the contrary. The Apoſtle ſignifies this, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, ſaying, <q>Becauſe they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved; therefore God ſhall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44335:86"/>ſend them ſtrong deluſions to believe a Lye: He ſhall ſend, not by commanding, but by letting the Devil looſe to deceive them, and lead them into a thouſand Errors, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the Truth, or Ancient Religion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But many of them ſay, (eſpecially the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ignorant) God will not ſuffer thoſe to be deceived who ſeek the Truth with an humble Heart: 'For he has promiſed to 'give the Good Spirit to thoſe that ask him: <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. But I do ſo; I beg of God to enlighten me, and open unto me the true ſence of Scripture; and I daily ſearch the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39.</p>
                  <p>This is a great deluſion of the Devil: For how do they ſeek the Truth with an humble Heart, who deſpiſe the judgment of the Doctors of the Church, the judgment of the Holy Fathers, and the judgment of General Councils? Who will not uſe that way which our Lord hath ſhewed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; but require unneceſſary Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? For, from them they may underſtand the Truth, and be freed from all Error; but they will not ſubmit to them; and think, that, by their own induſtry, wit, and private Spirit, they can more certainly find the Truth out of the bare Scriptures. As if the Holy Fathers, Doctors, and Prelates of the Church had not ſearched the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or were deſtitute of the Spirit of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44335:86"/>God, and right Judgment, that they could not rely upon them. Now, what greater Pride can be imagined, than for a private Man, (and for the moſt part ſilly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of all Antiquity, and the Liberal Arts) to prefer himſelf before ſo great Wiſdom, ſo great Authority and Sanctity, and ſuch a multitude of Doctors? Let them not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think (ſo long as they are of this mind) that they ſhall receive any thing of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wrongfully ſeek him, and proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ask him; but rather that they are deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit of Pride, and a Lye, to which they are delivered (by the juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God) for ſo great a Crime. This is that Spirit which all Hereticks (though never ſo contrary in their Opinions) boaſt and bragg of, and from which every one thinks the Truth is revealed to himſelf; which, certainly, he that is not ſtark Blind may eaſily perceive; becauſe the Spirit of God cannot reveal contraries.</p>
                  <p>Add hereunto, that the ſacred Scripture, no where ſends private Men to ſearch the Scriptures in Doubts of Faith, but to the Church, and thoſe which precede therein: So in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. they are ſent to the Prieſts in doubtful matters, who were then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Judges, and thoſe that would not obey them, were to be put to death. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Church, God hath appointed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44335:87"/>Paſtors and Doctors, and would have the Church conſpicuous to the whole World, the Pillar and Ground of Truth: <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. that all People might eaſily conſult it, and acquieſce ſecure in her Decrees. The Spirit of underſtanding the Scriputres. is not granted to every one, as 'tis plain by the Apoſtle: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 'Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although the Spirit ſhould ſuggeſt any thing to you, yet you are not ſecure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are not certain, it is of God: For 'tis manifeſt, that innumerable have been deceiv'd: For all Hereticks brag of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and <hi>Satan</hi> frequently transforms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of Light. Hereby it is manifeſt, that the private Spirit can be no Rule of faith.</p>

                  <head>The Twelfth Reaſon, from another great abſurdity.</head>
                  <p>IF any of theſe New Religions (for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample, the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Religion) were the true Religion of Chriſt, beſides the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities afore-mentioned, this would follow; that all Catholicks (which have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, from the time of the Apoſtles) are damned, and ſentenced to the Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell-Fire; becauſe (according to the chief Tenet of this Religion) they wanted juſtifying Faith, and therefore Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice before God; ſo that they remained in their ſins, and died in them: For the Faith neceſſary to Juſtification (as this Religion teacheth) is that whereby a Man firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, that he is juſt before God, by reaſon of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, which, by Faith, is applied and imputed to him.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis manifeſt, that this Faith was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the World till the time of <hi>Luther:</hi> Nor does he deny, but rather glories that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44335:88"/>he manifeſted to the World the true Nature of Juſtification, hid from the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The ſame is clear, by the Writings of all the antient Fathers, becauſe (beſides Faith in Chriſt) they require an inward change of the Will, and purpoſe of keeping the whole Law; alſo, for that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn this ſecurity of Salvation; and will have Men to work out their Salvation with fear and trembling, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſollicitous.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that this peculiar ſpecial Faith (whereby every one certainly believes he is juſt) they all reject, as meer preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. For although we ought to believe, that Chriſt has fully ſatisfied for us on his part; yet it does not appear to us, that we have done all things neceſſary on our part, to be made partakers of his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that we may not ſometime or other fall from him.</p>
                  <p>'Tis clear then, that all the Antients wanted this Faith. Therefore ſo many Holy Fathers, ſo many Martyrs, ſo many Virgins are damned. <hi>St. Irenaeus, St. Juſtin, St. Gregory Thaumaturgus, St. Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zian. St. Baſil.

To conclude, all our Anceſtors are damned, that have been from the Apoſtle's till <hi>Luther</hi>'s time; and to uſe the Words of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> 
                     <q>The Goſpel has been wrong Preached,<note place="margin">L. de preſcrip. adverſ.

                  </p>
                  <p>But how incredible, abſurd, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous are all theſe things? How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the judgment of the whole World, and of all Ages?</p>
                  <p>Nor can it be ſaid, that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for their ignorance; becauſe no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can be ſaved, without Faith, without the juſtice of Chriſt, without participation of Chriſt's Redemption; as every where the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44335:89"/>Scripture teacheth, eſpecially the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. No ignorance can excuſe, that a Man may be ſaved without theſe things; therefore there is no refuge here; either they are all damned, or the Religion of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> (in their principal Opinion of Juſtification) is falſe and impious.</p>

               <head>The Tenth Conſideration, and Concluſion of the whole Conſult.</head>
               <p>LAſtly, That Religion is to be imbrac'd in this Life, which Men are moſt like to be willing to profeſs at the hour of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of which they can render a juſt account at the Tribunal of Chriſt: For, in the practice of things, we cannot be better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, than by the conſideration of Death and Eternal Judgment; namely, to love that here, which at the point of death, will be moſt profitable to us; and to ſhun that which may bring upon us certain ruine and deſtruction, at leaſt put us in great peril of it: But the Catholick Religion is ſuch, as we ſhall certainly prefer at the hour of death: As is manifeſt,</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the example of many, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have lived Hereticks, yet when they came to die, have deſired to die Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, as judging it the ſafer way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:44335:90"/>Secondly, Becauſe every one wiſhes then, that he had done many Good Works, and with great diligence had avoided all ſin; to both of which, the Catholick Religion effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly exciteth; and to neither of which, does the Religion of <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin;</hi> but rather to a contempt of all Good Works, and licentiouſneſs of Life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the Catholick Religion has many Remedies, which in that dreadful paſſage are not to be deſpiſed; as Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for Sin, Abſolution of the Prieſt, the Sacrament of Extream Unction, and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, which give great conſolation and confidence to the Faithful. For, by this means, the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to us: But bare Faith is a very cold comfort, and a weak thing at the point of death: For how can you perſwade your ſelf, that God will be merciful to you, that you are juſt, and ſhall be ſaved by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt, who have deſpiſed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies ordained by him, and determined to die out of the Catholick Church? All the Sects of this time boaſt of this Faith; and yet certainly all are not ſaved: For the true Religion of Chriſt is but one (out of which there is no Salvation) as not only all Catholick, but likewiſe <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:44335:90"/>and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> teach: Therefore your ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Faith will avail you nothing, unleſs you have the true Religion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now, that all Profeſſors of the Catholick Religion may eaſily render an account of their Religion to the Supreme Judge, and fear no danger for being Catholicks, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: For, ſuppoſe, that I ſtand before that terrible Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, and am asked, why I followed the Catholick, or (as Hereticks call it) the Papiſts Religion, and not rather, by forſaking it, turn'd to the New Reformed Religion of <hi>Calvin.</hi> I will anſwer with great ſecurity, Therefore I profeſſed the Catholick Religion, becauſe it teaches me to withdraw my mind from the love of earthly things, and fix it upon heavenly: It teaches me to mortifie the Fleſh, to fear God, to practice Good works, to obey my Superiours, to be inſtant in Prayer, and to cut off all occaſions of Sin: I ſtuck to the Catholick Religion, becauſe I ſaw therein many famous over all the World, for Wiſdom, Holineſs, Miracles, and the Spirit of Prophecy; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to be deceived in ſo great a matter; becauſe I ſaw God hath eſtabliſhed this Church, for ſeveral Ages, by many Miracles; becauſe I ſaw therein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God fulfilled; for it is ſpread over all the World. To this Church the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44335:91"/>of Nations has been made hitherto, and is dayly making. In this Church there has been a continual Concord of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in points of Faith. In this Church there has been a perpetual Succeſſion of the Chair, and Connexion of all Miniſters with the Apoſtles. In this Church there is a ſpeedy deciſion of all Controverſies. This Church, for many Ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has ſtood immov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able againſt all Hereſies and Perſecutions of Tyrants, <hi>ſo that the Gates of Hell could never prevail againſt it,</hi> Matth. 16.18. But I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in all theſe New Religions, all things contrary to this; therefore there was no reaſon for me to renounce the Catholick Religion, or in the leaſt to doubt of it.</p>
               <p>But though I ſhould omit all this which I haye ſaid, Is not this alone ſufficient for my ſecurity, that I have followed a Religion. which thoſe have been of, who were moſt Holy and Famous for Miracles over all the World; as S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> S. <hi>Bernaod,</hi> S. <hi>Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> S. <hi>Francis,</hi> &amp;c. For it clearly appears, that ſuch Heavenly Souls, ſo dear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to God, ſuch beloved and familiar Friends, could not poſſibly be deceived in ſo great a buſineſs, as the Salvation of their Souls. Therefore I may ſecurely follow theſe Guides, in reference to Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:44335:91"/>But you now, who have followed ſome other New Religion,<note place="margin">What a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick can anſwer.</note> what account (I pray) can you make of it, when you ſhall be examined before the terrible Judgment-Seat of Chriſt? Perhaps you will anſwer the Judge, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſerted the Catholick Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thought it full of Idolatry, Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Humane Traditions. I thought that Antichriſt reigned in it; and I thought that Catholicks depended upon their own Merits, and not upon the price of your Blood.</p>
               <p>But what if the vail of Diabolical delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (which now blinds you) being then taken off, you ſee your ſelf clearly deceived, what Counſel will you take? For there will be ro more time and place for repentance. Perhaps you will plead Ignorance; but this will not excuſe you; becauſe you might have eaſily known the Truth, if you had uſed that diligence, which the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; nor did you ever want a juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of doubting, which ſhould have ſtirred you up to a diligent enquiry. As therefore it ſhall not excuſe the Jews, that they erred by ignorance, becauſe they might have known the Truth, if they would; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall it excuſe you: For, to depart from the Catholick Religion without ſin, you
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44335:92"/>ought not only to think and ſurmiſe, (by reaſon of ſome ſlight ſuſpicions,) but to know certainly, that ſuch Evil Doctrine is taught in the Catholick Church, by uſing diligence, and ſetting aſide all worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; ſo that no farther ſcruple could be left, nor any juſt reaſon to doubt.</p>
               <p>But you are ſo far from having any ſuch certainty of the Churches Errors, that no probable reaſon can be given for it.</p>
               <p>For what probability or ſhew of Truth, could induce you to believe that Religion was full of Idolatry and Errours, which you ſaw profeſſed by ſo many eminent Men, for Wiſdom and Holineſs of Life? Which you ſaw or might have ſeen confirmed with ſo many Miracles and Martyrs? Which you beheld diffuſed through the whole World? In which you ſaw ſo great Concord in points of Faith, and conſtant Succeſſion, Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, and Conjunction with the Apoſtles. How could it poſſibly be, that in ſo many Ages, none of the Holy Fathers and Doctors ſhould ſpy this Idolatry, theſe Superſtitions and Errors?</p>
               <p>Again, how could you be perſwaded to believe that to be the true Religion of Chriſt, which makes God the Author and Forcer of all Sin? Which takes away from Men Free-will? Which extirpates all Good Works? Which opens the Gate to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44335:92"/>of Wickedneſs, as much as Atheiſm? Which takes away ſubjection to Laws, and obedience to Princes, under pretence of Chriſtian Liberty? Which recalls from Hell many old and condemned Hereſies? Whoſe Authors were renowned for no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of Life, no Piety, no Miracles, but Men given to the Pleaſures of the Fleſh, covetous of worldly Goods, ambitious, ſlanderous, envious, ſeditious, infamous for Apoſtacy, ſacrilegious Marriages, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous Luſt, and inconſtancy of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If any of theſe New Religions are true, then the Church of Chriſt is fallen for ſo many Ages; the Kingdom of Chriſt is overthrown; the Divine Promiſes (touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtability of the Church) are fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and the Gates of Hell have prevailed againſt it. Then, for ſo many Ages, the Goſpel has been Preached in vain, and in vain believed; ſo many Gentiles have been in vain converted from Paganiſm, in vain Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and received other Sacraments; in vain they faſted and mortified the Fleſh, and ſo many thouſands in vain ſuffered Mrrtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by the effuſion of their Blood for the Confeſſion of Chriſt. Then all our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors are periſhed; the Holy Fathers are periſhed; ſo many Myriads of Confeſſors
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44335:93"/>(which were wholly devoted to God, and famous for Sanctity, Miracles, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy) are all periſhed and damned: For they were all without the true Religion and Righteouſneſs of God, and all addicted to Idolatry.</p>
               <p>But if theſe things are falſe, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and horrible to think, how could it be, you did not conceive theſe New Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions to be falſe (or at leaſt to doubt of them) from which ſuch cruel and frightful things are clearly deduced? But if you doubted, why did you not endeavour to know the Truth, upon which your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends?</p>
               <p>Our Lord admoniſhes us <hi>to beware of Falſe Prophets, which come to us in Sheeps-cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves,</hi> Matth. 7.16. What's the reaſon it did not come into your Mind ſometimes, and make you afraid, leſt <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould be in the Number of thoſe Falſe Prophets, which Chriſt warns you to beware of? for theſe came forth clad with a fair pretence of the Word of God, and purity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as if God ſent them to the Salvation of his Sheep; but, in the mean time, they deſtroyed theſe Sheep, with the venomous Food of their Doctrine: <hi>You ſhall know them</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:44335:93"/>Chriſt) <hi>by their Fruits,</hi> Matth. 7.16. Now what were their Fruits? Seditions, Wars, Plundering, ſubverſion of Churches and Monaſteries, deſtruction of Cities, extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Antient Religion, and a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to all Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>We know, by information of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that many Hereſies ſhall ariſe in the latter days, many falſe Prophets and Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers (by the Midwifry of <hi>Satan</hi>) ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the World. As oft therefore as any New Doctrine riſeth againſt the Church, we ought, at leaſt, to ſuſpect it, and the Author of it.</p>
               <p>Therefore I moſt humbly and earneſtly beſeech all thoſe who live out of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Catholick Church,<note place="margin">A Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Work.</note> by the Goodneſs of God which created us, and by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt which redeemed us, by the Eternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which we expect in Heaven, and the Torrent of Divine Pleaſure which they ſhall drink of, that retain Truth and Juſtice, to lay this buſineſs, ſeriouſly to Heart; that they would conſider whether they rely upon a ſure and firm Foundation, that may make them ſecure of their Religion at the hour of death, when they ſhall ſtand before the Tribunal of Chriſt, and in that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>Let them conſider, what great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they incur, if the Religion (which they profeſs) is Hereſie, and they themſelves Hereticks. That it is a Hereſie (and a moſt notorious and pernicious one too) all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctors, all Univerſities, and the whole Chriſtian World (except thoſe which are of it, who are but few in number, and ſlender in Learning, to thoſe that are againſt them) undoubtedly and for certain affirm it. So that finite Numbers have died, and are ready to die for the Confeſſion of it to be Hereſie, rather than venture the Eternal Damnation of their Souls, by complying with it.</p>
               <p>Hereſie, certainly, is a moſt grievous ſin.<note place="margin">How great a ſin Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is.</note> Firſt, Becauſe it makes a Man prefer his own judgment, before the judgment of all the Fathers, of all the Doctors of the Church, of all Councils and Biſhops of the whole

               <p>Laſtly, Every Heretick wiſhes an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the whole Church, and that the Catholick Religion were totally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
               <p>The Hereſies therefore of our times ſwell with Pride, many horrible Blaſphemies, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny invectives, and detractions, many Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and moſt bitter hatred againſt the Church of Church of Chriſt; for theſe things are as it were intrinſically in Hereſie; which habitually inclines to all theſe things, and daily urges and excites to action.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:44335:95"/>All Catholick Doctors thus judge of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie; and the matter is plain enough of it ſelf. Therefore Hereſie (with its iſſue and attendance) is a greater Crime, than innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſins of Catholicks.</p>
               <p>Now I beſeech them to conſider,<note place="margin">How great a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment the ſin of Hereſie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</note> what will be the great puniſhment of this ſin of Hereſie: For, if for one Crime of Theft, for one Act of Fornication (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true repentance) a Man ſhall ſuffer Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fire, as the Scripture plainly tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. how great puniſhment ſhall he endure for the ſin of Hereſie, which is more grievous than a thouſand Thefts, and a thouſand Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?

Let no Man flatter himſelf, that Hell-Fire will be no pain; but only I know not what Terrours of God's anger, as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> dreameth.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44335:95"/>the Wicked, Fire and Brimſtone, and a burning Tempeſt; this ſhall be the Portion of their Cup. Thou ſhalt make them as a fiery Oven in the time of thine anger.

                  </hi> Apoc. 20 10. The ſame is the Opinion of all the Antient Fathers and Doctors of the Church.</p>
               <p>It is therefore moſt certain, that Hell-fire is a true and real Fire, greater and fiercer than all our Fires, made never ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by the Art of Man, (which are but as painted Fires in compariſon of the heat of Hell-fire) wherein all Hereticks ſhall burn and be tormented day night for all Eternity; as long as Hell ſhall be Hell; as long as Heaven ſhall be Heaven, and as long as God ſhall remain God; and the ſmoak of their Torments ſhall aſcend before the Face of our Lord for ever and ever. Theſe are moſt faithful and true Words.</p>
               <p>Then they will curſe their Deceivers and Maſters who brought them into this Miſery. They will curſe the Devil which blinded them, and with divers deluſions bewitched them, under the colour and ſhew of Piety. They will curſe themſelves for being ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile to give eaſe to them, and believe their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44335:96"/>new Doctrine ſo fooliſhly, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent inquiry; that, in a buſineſs of ſo great conſequence, they were ſo blind and ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>Leſt therefore they ſhould ruſh headlong into this Sea of Miſery, let them with all care and diligence examine this whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Religion by prudent and pious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors; particularly, let them but ſuſpend their prejudice a little, which uſes to be a great hindrance to this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deliberation;<note place="margin">Things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to inquire the Truth.</note> I mean a certain prepoſſeſſed Opinion (which many have) of the Idolatry, Superſtition, and Abuſes of the Catholick Church. As, that they Worſhip a piece of Bread for God, pray to dead Men, Worſhip Croſſes and Pictures, truſt in their own Merits, believe a Man can forgive Sins, and many ſuch Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries; and are poſſeſſed with what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have been taught, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to pray to God to have farther infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, leaſt they ſhould ſin, by ſeeming to doubt of the Faith they have been taught by their Parents, and their Miniſters, to whom they have been recommended by them, to harken unto, as Orthodox Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. And if they happen to read any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Books, and meet with ſome things they themſelves cannot anſwer, their afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:44335:96"/>prejudice preſently ſuggeſts to them, that thoſe Miniſters can anſwer them; and to diſcourſe with ſome learned Catholick, they upon the ſame ground are afraid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuſpect their integrity, and ſo they remain in the Belief they have been educated in, as well ſatisfied. Now I ſay,</p>
               <p>Let them lay aſide (for a while) this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and but ſuppoſe they may be deceived therein, and that things are not ſo, as they have been told: For, at leaſt, it ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what incredible, that ſo many moſt Holy and Learned Men (which this Church has always abounded with) ſhould never ſee this Idolatry (if there were any;) or ſeeing it, ſhould not renounce it; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diligently retain and love it. This is an old Calumny of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Iconomachiſts,</hi> or Image-Breakers. And there was never any Sect of Hereticks, which did not forſake the Church with envious and malicious Hearts, and tax it with horrible Crimes; for they are forced to make this pretence, that they might ſeem juſtly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let them daily beg of God to enlighten them, that they may clearly know which is the true Religion and Church of Chriſt, and ſhew themſelves ready prepared
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44335:97"/>to imbrace the ſame. <hi>No Man can come to me</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>unleſs my Father draw him,</hi> Joh. 6.44. None can come to Chriſt by true Faith, without illumination of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father. Therefore, let them humbly and daily pray to God, that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe them a Beam of Light to ſee and profeſs the true Belief; ſaying with the Prophet <hi>David, Lighten mine Eyes, leſt I ſleep the ſleep of Death; leſt my Enemy ſay</hi> (when I depart out of this Life) <hi>I have prevailed againſt him,</hi> Pſal. 13 3, 4. <hi>Send out thy Light and thy Truth, let them lead me, let them bring me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Holy Hill, and to thy Tabernacles,</hi> Pſal. 43.3. <hi>Cauſe me to know the way wherein I ſhould walk; for I lift up my Soul unto thee. Deliver me from the Enemies of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O Lord, I fly unto thee, teach me to do thy Will, for thou art my God;</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let them add to their Prayer, Alms and Bounty to the Poor. How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent theſe two things are to obtain of God a Light of the true Religion, the Example of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion ſhews, to whom the Angel ſaid, <hi>Cornelius, thy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and thy Alms are come up for a Memorial before God; and now ſend Men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whoſe Sirname is Peter, he ſhall tell thee what thou oughteſt to do,</hi> Act. 10.4.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44335:97"/>Let<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them imitate the Example of this Man, that earneſtly deſired of God to be directed in finding out the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Let them diligently (with an ardent deſire of knowing the Truth) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is ſaid in this Conſultation; and if they have any doubt or diſſatisfaction, let them addreſs themſelves to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctors or Prieſts, who will eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them in all points of Faith; ſo that at length, they ſhall obtain (by the Grace of God) a quiet Conſcience, and full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the knowledge of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>This is the Prayer and Supplication of all the Children of this Holy Mother, in their behalf: That thou, O true and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Light! the Enlightner of Men and Angels, wouldſt enlighten their Minds, and inſpire them to do what is here adviſed them: For, although they are ſeduced by the deceit of the Devil, and have departed from thee, and thy Church; yet they are thy Creatures, made according to thy I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Likeneſs, redeemed with the price of thy Sacred Blood, and called to the Inheritance and Society of thy Celeſtial and Eternal Kingdom. Let no ſo Glorious
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44335:98"/>a Work of thine periſh, which coſt thee ſo dear, which may render thee Eternal Praiſes by the Knowledge of the Truth, and redound to thy Eternal Glory. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel this black Cloud which obſcures their underſtanding, remove the Faſcination of the Devil, which blinds the Eyes of their Mind, and perverts their Fancy and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſtrike in them a horrour and fear of that Fire inextinguiſhable, and thoſe Eternal Flames, prepared for all thoſe that are deſtitute of the true Religion; infuſe into them an ardent Love and Deſire of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the knowledge of the Truth, to the Salvation of their Souls. Shew them the light of thy Mercies, that they may know thy Sheep-fold, and underſtand that That was none of thy Sheep-fold which they were in before, but the Devils; in which, whoſoever remains, are reſerved as Sheep, not to Life, but to Perdition, that they may be Fuel for Hell fire, and Food for death, <hi>Death ſhall feed on them,</hi> Pſal. 49.4. Bring them back again to thy Sheep-fold, that being refreſhed with the wholeſome Food of thy Doctrine, and of thy wonderful Sacraments, they may be healed of their old Wounds made by <hi>Satan,</hi> and grow in thy Spirit, the Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and fear of our Lord, the Spirit
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44335:98"/>of Meekneſs and Charity, and be quickned to Eternal Life; that after this momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Life, they may be partakers of thy Eternal Glory and Happineſs; and praiſe, bleſs, and glorifie thy Name for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Laſtly, I admoniſh all Catholicks,<note place="margin">An admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</note> that they would ſeriouſly conſider with themſelves, what a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit it is, that God by his ſpecial favour (before innumerable others) has made them Profeſſors of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; in what a ſtrict obligation of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude they are bound to the Divine Majeſty, for ſo great a Mercy.</p>
               <p>How few have this Gift of Faith, if you reflect on the infinite Number of thoſe, who go aſtray, or doubt; and therefore the more to be eſteemed. Let them conſider, that amongſt all worldly Goods, nothing is to be compared to it; neither Pleaſures, nor Honours, nor thouſands of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, nor Sceptres and Crowns. The Jewel of true Religion is infinitely better, and more precious than all theſe. He that has it, is truly rich, although poor in Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods, as being a Citizen of the Saints,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44335:99"/>a Child of God, an Heir of the Kingdom of Heaven, and Coheir with Chriſt, if he lives according to the profeſſion of his Faith. He that is without the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is thrice unhappy and miſerable, though he ſhould abound with the Goods and Proſperity of this World. 'Tis moſt certain there is but one way to Eternal Happineſs. It is an Atheiſtical Opinion, that every one may be ſaved in different Religions; for, as there is but one God, one Chriſt, one Truth, one Right-way, one Juſtice; ſo there is but one true Faith, one true Religion one true Congregation, or Church of God and Chriſt, out of which there is no Salvation. Let them beware, leſt by a curioſity of reading or hearing, or uncautious converſation with Hereticks, or deſire of pleaſing any Mortal Man, or fear of Perſecution, or loſs of Temporal Life or Eſtate, or loſs of gain, or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Honour, or for any other cauſe; they loſe ſo great a Good: <hi>For what is a Man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? Or, what ſhall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> But a loſs of the true Religion is a loſs of the Soul; which no Wiſe Man will part with, upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:44335:99"/>Thoſe are unhappy Souls, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Name of a Chriſtian, who little regard the ruine of the Catholick Church or Religion, ſo they may but ſafely and quietly enjoy a Temporal Peace, to live in ſenſuality, or hoard up riches, and the trifling goods of this Life. But this mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and vile eſteem of ſo great a Good, ſhall coſt them dear, when this momentary Life ſhall be ended, and they ſuddenly fall into an endleſs Eternity.</p>
               <p>Many Seducers are gone forth into the World, many under Sheeps cloathing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſmooth pretence of God's Word, hide a Wolfiſh Nature, to the deſtruction of Chriſt's Sheep. Our Lord hath admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us (more than once) carefully to beware of them. The Apoſtles and Holy Fathers have often warned us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 13. <hi>He that touches pitch ſhall be defiled, and he that loveth danger ſhall periſh therein,</hi> Eccleſ. 3. The Times were never more dangerous and deſtructive to our Salvation, than now: the Faſcination of the Devil was never greater, nor a Spiritual frenzy more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with Men; the operation of Errour was never more prevailing and ſucceſsful; and the minds of Men never blinder; all which (deſervedly) poſſeſs the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44335:100"/>of thoſe that diſeſteem this great Gift of the Catholick and Orthodox Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and prefer Temporal Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
               <p>Let thoſe therefore that heartily deſire to be ſaved, preſerve this Celeſtial Jewel, and keep it with all carefulneſs, becauſe Life proceeds from it; and becauſe 'tis a Supernatural Gift, which (without the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance) can neither be acquired nor preſerved, being invironed with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Enemies. Let them daily implore Gods help for themſelves, their Children, and whole Family, and add unto their Prayers, Alms to the Poor, with other Works of Piety; for Prayer is good with Faſting and Alms, <hi>and better than to heap up Treaſures of Gold,</hi> Job. 12. Let them lead Lives agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Religion, and allay their Thirſt after the Goods of this Life, with expectation and hope of Celeſtial and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; remembring the Saying of the Apoſtle. 1 Tim 6.9. <hi>They that will be rich fall into Temptation, and the ſnares of the Devil, and many unprofitable and hurtful deſires, which drown Men in deſtruction and perdition; for the root of all Evil is Covetouſneſs, which ſome deſiring, have erred from the Faith, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled themſelves in many ſorrows.</hi> By theſe

            <head type="sub">Whether every one may be ſaved in his own Faith and Religion.</head>
            <p>WE have ſaid, in the Preface of the foregoing Treatiſe, that it was a ſtupid and groſs Errour of ſome, that think it ſufficient to Salvation, if they believe in Chriſt, and that he died for our Sins; and we briefly demonſtrated their Errour with certain Reaſons: But becauſe this Errour is now far ſpread, and hath infected the Minds of many, I am intreated to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care the ſame more at large. Therefore I ſhall divide the matter into Two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:44335:102"/>The Firſt is, Whether it be ſufficient to Salvation, to believe in God, and do no Body any injury; that is to ſay, Whether every one may be ſaved in his own private Faith or Belief, if he endeavours to live honeſtly and virtuouſly?</p>
            <p>The Second is, That ſuppoſing that Faith in Chriſt is neceſſary, Whether that alone be ſufficient, or whether we ought to believe ſomething elſe?</p>
            <div n="1" type="question">

               <head>The Firſt Queſtion.</head>
               <p>AS to the Firſt Queſtion, many, at this time,<note place="margin">The Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Adverſaries Opinion.</note> are of, Opinion, that every one may be ſaved in his own Faith or Religion. The Reaſon which they chiefly give is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeems to them incredible, that all Jews and Turks (many of which Worſhip God devoutly in their way, and deal juſtly with their Neighbours) ſhould be damned eternally, only becauſe they do not believe in Chriſt; ſince, in this regard, they ſeem not to offend very much, becauſe (from their infancy) they were taught otherwiſe: For why ſhould God (who would have all to be ſaved) make the way of Salvation ſo ſtrict? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. Why ſhould he condemn to Eternal Puniſhment theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Wretches (who ſtudy to pleaſe him, according to their Capacity, who do no Man any Wrong, but obſerve Juſtice and honeſty of Life) meerly for ignorance of that which they have not been ſufficiently inſtructed in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:44335:103"/>But this Opinion, though conſulting only Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">It is refuted with Four Reaſons.</note> ir ſeems to have ſome ſhew of Truth and Equity; yet conſidering thoſe things which God hath revealed to us in Scripture, is altogether a Paradox: For, if every Turk or Jew may be ſaved in his own Faith or Belief, then in vain the Apoſtles and Holy Fathers laboured ſo much to plant the Faith of Chriſt; for they might abſtain from a profeſſion of this Doctrine, without loſs of their Salvation, and remain content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Jews, with a coufeſſion of one God. I add moreover. Chriſt therefore was made Man in vain; he wrought ſo many Miracles in vain, that People might believe him to be the Meſſias, and Saviour of the Would in vain he was Crucified and died; for none of theſe things were neceſſary to Man's Salvation: It had been enough to have ſent Preachers through the World to perſwade Mortals to believe in one God. The Apoſtle uſes this way of arguing, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>If Juſtice be by the Law, then Chriſt died in vain,</hi> Gal. 2.21. that is, if Juſtice may be obtained by the knowledge of one God, and obſervation of the Law, then Chriſt died in vain; becauſe his Death was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation.</p>

                  <hi>Second Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the whole Scripture will he found falſe and lying; which teaches, <hi>That Chriſt is our Mediator, Redeemer, and Saviour, which propoſes him a Propitiator for us, by Faith in his Blood,</hi> Rom. 3. <hi>by whoſe Svcrifice, we are reconciled to God; by whoſe Blood we are cleanſed from our Sins, and by whoſe Faith we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Apoc. 1.7. <hi>for there is no other Name under Heaven given among Men whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> Act. 4.12. All theſe things were in vain, and falſe, if every one might be ſaved in his own Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Perhaps ſome will ſay, that Chriſt is indeed our Redeemer, and all Good to us proceeds from him; yet a belief in him is not abfolutely neceſſary to Salvation; for it ſufficeth to believe, that all our Happineſs ſprings from the Bounty of God, and is needleſs to know the means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this is repuguant to the Holy Scripture, and Reaſon; becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture plainly teaches, that Chriſt's Redemption is not applied to us,<note place="margin">Why Faith in Chriſt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> but by Faith in him; and therefore all that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44335:104"/>in Sin, and are the Children of Wrath, and Damnation. 'Tis likewiſe againſt Reaſon; becauſe to be made partakers of any great and ſingular benefit, all reaſon requireth to know our Benefit and Benefactor; that we may know him (as 'tis meet) with all thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; for the condition of the Benefit and Benefactor, requires this gratitude; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince the benefit of our Redemption is ſo ſtrange and great, and he that gave it ſo ſublime and excellent, and the manner of beſtowing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It ſo wonderful, 'tis requiſite we ſhould know all this, leaſt we ſhould live and die altogether ungrateful to ſo great a Benefactor; leaſt, like the Jews, we ſhould return Curſes for a Bleſſing, and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for Thanksgiving. 'Tis therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, that thoſe who believe not in Chriſt, ſhould be partakers of the ſame Happineſs with them that are to be ſaved by Faith in Chriſt; the which alſo is confirmed by this that none can be ſaved, who is ignorant of God, and the benefit of his Creation; elſe all Idolaters may be ſaved; therefore, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can be ſaved, that is ignorant of the benefit of our Redemption; becauſe the benefit of our Redemption is far greater and more admirable, and pertains more to the Glory of God and Chriſt, and requires of us a more ample Honour, Service, and Thanksgiving.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:44335:104"/>Nor is it ſufficient to know in general,<note place="margin">The benefit of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is to be known in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</note> that all this Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes to us from God; this is not enough to pay that gratitude and honour due to him; but we ought to know what and how great this benefit is; how, and in what manner and way he conferred it; namely, that he delivered us from Sin, and Eternal Death, that he opened us the paſſage to Eternal Life, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, by a way moſt ſtupendious and ſtrange; to wit, by uniting our Nature to his own, and therein ſuffering death for us: For this chiefly commends his Charity, Mercy, and Juſtice; this requires of us all Obedience, all Praiſe, Benediction, and Thanks-giving; and theſe are principally to be known by us, as neceſſary to Salvation.</p>

               <p>Again, if every one may be ſaved in his own Faith, then that Faith ſufficeth to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which is no infuſed gift of God, but a Humane Perſwaſion, conceived by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgment, ſupported by Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and built on a fallible foundation: For although the <hi>Turks</hi> believe one God, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and Rewarder of Good and Evil Works; yet this Faith is not from the Holy Ghoſt, but from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44335:105"/>Judgment, or rather from the Devil: for they do not ſo believe, becauſe God hath revealed it to Men by ſome true Prophet, but becauſe <hi>Mahomet</hi> (whom they imagine to be God's Prophet and Inſtrument to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct Mortals) has ſo declared it in his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran.</hi> Therefore, although that which they believe is true, yet becauſe the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and all their reaſon of believing is falſe and pernicious; to wit, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is a Prophet of God: the Faith it ſelf (whereby they believe) is deceitful, and (in regard of the foundation on which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends) is noxious and deſtructive to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neceſſarily infecting the Mind with the contagious Errours of that Sect. How then can it be ſaid, that that Faith is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to their Salvation, or that they can be ſaved by this Faith? How can that Faith, which is uncertain, fallible, and peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, be laid for a foundation of Juſtice and Salvation?</p>
               <p>In like manner, the Jews, although they believe the ſame things, and many more conſonant to Truth, yet that Faith (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they believe theſe things) is deceitful, and far from the Spirit of God: For, the main reaſon of their belief is, becauſe their Rabbins and Doctors of their Synagogue ſo interpret the Scriptures: for theſe are a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44335:105"/>Rule of Faith to them, or (which is the ſame thing) the Holy Scripture, as 'tis ſubject to their Interpretation: But all this reaſon of believing is falſe and deceitful, and no leſs harmful than that of the <hi>Turks.</hi> For, now it is as bad to believe the <hi>Rabbins</hi> to be indued with the Spirit of God (for the right interpretation of Scripture) as <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be a Prophet of God; nor are they driven to leſs abſurdities by force of that Principle: How then can ſuch a Faith be the <hi>Baſis</hi> or Ground-work of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, This Opinion makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Turciſm, Judaiſm, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but in ſome ſmall matters, nothing at all neceſſary to Salvation; ſo that 'tis all one what Religion you live in, becauſe you may be ſaved in any; which is to open a way to the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and to equalize <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> with Chriſt, or rather to introduce A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm: For, to allow of every Religion, is to take away all Religion, and think none neceſſary; ſince there can be but one only true Religion.</p>
               <p>The Fundamental Reaſon (on which this Opinion chiefly depends) is of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:44335:106"/>For, Firſt, if it be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, That God for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand years,<note place="margin">An Anſwer to the Foundation of the other O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</note> left the whole World in Idolatry (except the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, a little part of it) and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame to run headlong into deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, although amongſt them there were many famous Wits, and ſerious Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of their Gods, and Lovers of Humane Juſtice and Honeſty; it ought not to ſeem incredible, that the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> (at this time) live in the ſtate of damnation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> (now) who believe not in Chriſt, are leſs excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then (of old) the Heathens were, that did not acknowledge one God, Maker of Heaven and Earth. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, when almoſt the whole World was overſpread with Idolatry, the violence of common cuſtom ſwept away all; nor did reaſon much ſway with private Men to doubt of their Religion; and if any doubt did ariſe, there was no eaſie way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth. But (now) ſince the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith hath compaſſed the World, ſo that Chriſtians are to be found every where, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> have manifold occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to doubt of their Religion; and if they refuſe or careleſly neglect to confer with
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44335:106"/>Chriſtians about it, out of hatred to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, or any other cauſe, they render themſelves inexcuſable before God. For the Affair of Religion and Salvation is of ſo great moment and concern, that it is to be preferred before all other things, and ought (with the greateſt care and diligence) to be ſought after (where there is juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to doubt) although you were to go into the remoteſt Countries for ſatisfaction.</p>

               <p>Many (eſpecially the Vulgar) think this to be ſufficient, if they believe thoſe things concerning God and Chriſt, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Apoſtles Creed; all other matters they count indifferent, and that every one may believe of them as he is really convinced; for they think that every one may believe the Creed, according to his own ſenſe and interpretation.

Therefore they cannot fail of their Salvation, although
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44335:107"/>they diſſent in many other things. Hence it is, that ſome Princes (which are of theſe New Religions) labour very much to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh and amplifie their Dominions, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> but one Church, and endeavouring to perſwade the People, that there is no difference amongſt them, but only in ſome ſmall Matters and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>But this Opinion brings with it many ill Conſequences.</p>

The <hi>Arrians</hi> then may be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Hereſie, who deny the Son of God to be of the ſame Subſtance with his Father. The <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who made the Holy Ghoſt inferiour to the Son. The <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> who held two Perſons in Chriſt. The <hi>Eutychians,</hi> who affirmed, that the Fleſh of Chriſt was converted into his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The <hi>Apollinariſts,</hi> who held the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word (inſtead of a Rational Soul) united to the Fleſh of Chriſt. The <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholites,</hi> who maintained, that there was but

The <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who denied Original Sin, and taught, that Man, by the force of Nature, might be able to merit the Grace of God and Salvation. The <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who averr'd that the Church of Chriſt was every where periſh'd, but only in their own Communion. The <hi>Novatians,</hi> who denied repentance to faln Sinners. The <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> who thought <hi>Montanus</hi> was the Holy Ghoſt. All theſe (according to this Opinion) are ſaved in their ſeveral Faiths and Hereſies, becauſe they believed in Chriſt, and the Apoſtles Creed, as now the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> do: But what can be counted more abſurd, and a greater Paradox in the Church of Chriſt? For, if Salvation may be had by ſuch a Faith, why were ſo many Councils (by a Convocation of Biſhops throughout the whole World) celebrated, at ſo great labour and charge, againſt theſe Hereſies? Why were they ſo often Anathematized? Why did the Holy Fathers ſtrive ſo much to extirpate them? Why were Catholicks ſo much afraid of ſociety and familiarity with thoſe Hereticks? Why did many of them rather ſuffer baniſhment, death, and all kind of torments, than ſubſcribe to any of their Hereſies? Certainly, all theſe things were done in valn, fooliſhly, and injuriouſly, if Salvation might be obtained in theſe Sects;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:44335:108"/>which ſince no Wiſe Man can affirm, we muſt needs confeſs, that theſe Hereſies are the Plagues of the Mind, and no Salvation can poſſibly conſiſt with them.</p>

               <p>Becauſe it condemns all Antiquity of Errour, which always judged, that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks could not be ſaved; and therefore ſo fiercely oppoſed them and always ſtudied ſo carefully to confute them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Becauſe it condemns the Apoſtle, who thus writes to <hi>Titus: A Man that is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, after the Firſt and Second Admonition, avoid, knowing, that he that is ſuch a one, is ſubverted and ſinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.</hi> Why is he commanded to avoid him, if his Errour was not prejudicial to Salvation? Why does he ſay that he is ſubverted? Again, <hi>Their Speech ſpreads as a Canker, or Gangreen,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.17. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Canker is Mortal to the Body, unleſs it be cut, ſo is an Heretick to the Company of the Faithful; and therefore they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to hear their Sermons, or read their

               <p>But it may be ſome will ſay, that no Body is to be eſteemed a Heretick, unleſs he denies Chriſt or ſome Article of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed: But this is altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly and abſurdly ſaid; for then he would not be an Heretick that ſhould renounce the Old and New Teſtament, and ſay, that it is connterfeited, or written by the Spirit of Man, and liable to many Errours, as are the writings of prophane Authors. He would not be an Heretick, that ſhould deny Hell, or Eternal Puniſhment; or that ſhould hold, that all the Devils ſhall be ſaved; ſince none of theſe things are in the Apoſtles Creed. He would not be an Heretick that ſhould condemn Marriage, and alledge that Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is Diabolical; that ſhould judge ſome Meats to be impure or unclean of their own Nature, which the Apoſtle eſteems Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. Laſtly, he would not be an Heretick, that ſhould affirm that there were Two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Chriſt, whom St. <hi>John</hi> calls an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick and Antichriſt, 1 <hi>Epiſt. c</hi> 4. nor would he be an Heretick that denies Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and all the Sacraments.

               <p>This Opinion renders all Hereſies and Sectaries equal with the Orthodox Faith, judging Salvation may as well be obtained by them, as by it.

Then 'tis all one, Whether you believe the Creed in ſuch a manner, or in no manner. Then every one may be ſaved, though he does not believe many Articles of Faith. The ſame I may ſay of the Scriptures; for if it be ſufficient to believe the Scriptures, according to every one's interpretation, ſince his ſence may be oftentimes erroneous, 'twill be alſo enough, though you do not believe them at all; For a falſe Faith can be no more neceſſary to Salvation, than no Faith, whereby a Man believes nothing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely.</p>
               <p>But if you ſay, that we muſt believe the Symbol or Creed in its true ſence, then you condemn the Sectaries of theſe times, none of which believe all the Articles of the Creed in the ſame ſence with Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; and all of them differ in the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Creed, amongſt themſelves: Therefore (ſince there is but only One Truth) all the Religions of theſe Times muſt neceſſarily ſwerve from the Truth, except One only; and therefore are inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Salvation.</p>

               <p>The Holy Scripture is of no leſs Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than the Apoſtles Creed, nor is it a leſs injury to God, to deny any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declared in the Scriptures, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject any Article of the Apoſtles Creed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no reaſon, why our Faith ſhould be tyed to the Creed, and in other things we ſhould be left to our Liberty, ſeeing we are as much obliged to believe all things in Scripture, as in the Apoſtles Creed: For, although we are not bound to know all things diſtinctly contained in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; yet we ought to believe in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; inſomuch, that we cannot (without the ſin of Hereſie) reject any part thereof, as falſe and doubtful.

For as the motive of our belief is (which we call the Foundation of our Faith) ſuch is the Faith it ſelf. If that be certain and cannot be deceitful, our Faith alſo is certain and infallible. If it be deceitful, our Faith alſo will be uncertain and liable to Errour: For Example, The <hi>Turk</hi> believes that there is one God, Creator of all things: Why? Becauſe the Alcoran ſo teaches; which he believes to be written by the Spirit of God: His Faith (although this which he believes be true) depends on a falſe and fallacious foundation, by force of which he is bound to believe many falſe and blaſphemous things; as that there are not Three Perſons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; that Chriſt is not God, and that he is leſs
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:44335:112"/>than <hi>Mahomet;</hi> that Circumciſion is to be obſerved, and the like. Therefore this Faith (by virtue of this foundation) is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible and erroneous. 'Tis the ſame caſe with all <hi>Hereticks.</hi>

               <p>That the firſt Foundation (namely, the authority of <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and others, that deviſed theſe New Religions) is deceitful, is manifeſt; becauſe experience ſhews they could be deceived, and did really err in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things: For many things they revoked, many things they corrected, they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted themſelyes in many things, as is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated in the Ninth Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Sixth Reaſon of my Conſult

               <p>Nor is the other ground leſs deceitful, to wit, their own private judgment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they expound the Scriptures: For many things which are indeed falſe, to a private Judgment ſeem to be true; and thoſe things which at firſt ſeemed to be true, are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found to be falſe. Hence it is, that there are ſuch diverſity of Opinions, ſuch chopping and changing of Religions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Humane Judgment is very weak, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Myſteries of Faith and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Scripture, which tranſcend Humane Capacity.</p>
               <p>Many Anſwer, that in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Whether they rely on Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> they do not rely on their own judment, but the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which cannot err. How miſerably they are deceived here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, appears by this; that almoſt all Sectaries ſay, they rely upon Scripture, when they diſagree in many things amongſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:44335:114"/>themſelves and teach things contrary to one anothers Doctrine, which could not ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be done, if they relyed upon the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful underſtanding of Scripture, and not on their own private judgment: For the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is no where contrary to it ſelf; it diſagrees in no place with it ſelf; therefore the reaſon why they ſo much differ amongſt themſelves is, becauſe they interpret the ſence of Scripture, according to their own private Judgment, which is divers, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the variety of Judgments and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of Men. They rely therefore upon Scripture, not as 'tis interpreted by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers of the Catholick Church, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own private Judgment: For the virtue and efficacy of the Scripture, conſiſts not in the naked <hi>Words,</hi> but in the <hi>right meaning</hi> and interpretation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their whole foundation is their own private judgment, which, how deceitful it is, the diſſentions of ſo many Sects clearly demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Third Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their belief (on which many,<note place="margin">The private Spirit.</note> at this time, depend) is the moſt deceitful of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, among the Fanaticks (who pretend moſt of all to the inſtinct of the Spirit) there are the greateſt differences and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44335:114"/>amongſt themſelves; which could not be, unleſs the Spirit (which rules and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns them, and on which they depend) were deceitful and various. The ſame is obſervable amongſt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> and the different Sects and Factions of them both: for every one is certain of the truth of his Opinion, by the private Spirit, which inſtructs him; whereby it is moſt manifeſt and clear, that this Spirit is not the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God and Truth (which cannot teach contradictions and be againſt it ſelf) but the Wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Spirit of Errour, <hi>Who is a Lyar from the beginning, and the Father of Lies, who lives in the Children of unbelief,</hi> Joh. 8.44. of whom the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved, therefore God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions to believe a Lye,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Theſ. 2.11. And in another place, <hi>In the latter times, ſome ſhall depart from the Faith, attending to the Spirits of Errour, and Doctrines of Devils,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.1. for every Hereſie is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils. And <hi>S. John, Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God, becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.1.</p>
               <p>This is that Spirit which rules in the Hearts of Hereticks, and whoſe Teſtimony
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44335:115"/>brag of, as thinking it to be the Holy Ghoſt. This ſo blinds their Underſtandings, and perverts their Fancies, that they take Light to be Darkneſs and Darkneſs Light; they eſteem the moſt clear Truth of the Catholick Faith to be Errour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their own foul and diſmal Errours to be the clear Truth; and certainly were they not totally bewitched and blinded, they might eaſily perceive, that that Spirit (which inwardly they feel) is not the Spirit of God, (or at leaſt, they could not chooſe but doubt of it,) ſince every Sect (amongſt whom there is ſo great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion touching their chiefeſt Principles) lays equal claim to the Teſtimony of this Spirit, boaſt of it, and follow it, and in maintaing their Tenets (repugnant to each other) chiefly depend on it. But this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by the juſt Judgment of God: For as the Jews who would not receive Chriſt, were permitted to be blinded by the Devil, as 'tis plainly gathered from the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. So Hereticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have deſerted the Catholick Faith (which is no leſs a Sin than that of the Jews) are permitted to be blinded by <hi>Satan,</hi> and led into all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:44335:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>And if a Man but attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider,<note place="margin">A greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination of the Devil in our Hereticks than in the Jews.</note> he ſhall perceive a more powerful operation of the Devil in our Hereticks, and a greater facination of their Mind, than there is in the Jews and Turks; and this for two Reaſons.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, Becauſe the Jews agree in their Belief, and have no different Sects amongſt them Among the Turks or Mahometans there be only two, and they not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: But amongſt the Hereticks of our days there are numbers of Sects, ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated one out of another, by the riſe of New Opinions, mutually condemning one another of Hereſie; and all theſe are ſprung up within 100 years or thereabout, which is a clear ſign, that the Devil has a great power in the Minds of theſe Man, to diſturb their Fancies, pervert their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Judgments, that they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtand nor reſt any where.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:44335:116"/>Secondly, Becauſe the vulgar People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews and Turks, rely not upon their own judgment, nor the inſtinct and teſtimony of the private Spirit, but upon the judgment of their Doctors, or (which is the ſame thing) upon their Scripture, as 'tis expounded by the Doctors of their own Religion. Therefore they have ſome Rule of Faith, and Foundation of their Belief, agreeable to Natural Reaſon; namely, the conſent of their Anceſtors, or the Scripture interpreted, according to the Sence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of their Anceſtors.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But moſt of the Hereticks of our Times, regard not much their Anceſtors and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles from whom they firſt received this New Goſpel; but looking upon them as Men ſubject to Errour, (though they alſo pretended to the Spirit, as well as theſe,) forſake them, and rely totally upon their own judgment or teſtimony of their own private Spirit, or (which is all one) the Holy Scripture, according to the ſence of their own judgment, or private Spirit; which is an evident ſign, that <hi>Satan</hi> ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually operates in them, and infatuates their Minds, that not only every one frames to himſelf New Hereſies and Opinions, but makes his own judgment the foundation of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:44335:116"/>his Faith, and Rule of Belief; for every one thinks he is taught of God (even Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children) and therefore ſecure from all Errour. What greater facination and Deluſion can there be than this? Hence it is, that they have no certain and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Principles, they decree no Body of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion, but ramble in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, as the private Spirit ſhall drive them: Nor can there be any diſpute with them, about any of their Principles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſtick to none, and (by reaſon of their ignorance) they know not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their Anceſtors: But of this Spirit of Giddineſs we have ſaid more in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation: <hi>Conſid.</hi> 9. and <hi>Reaſon</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Hereby it is manifeſtly concluded, that the whole Foundation of Faith (which the Sectaries of our time rely on) is deceitful, and therefore their Belief (which depends on it) is unprofitable to Salvation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If every one may be ſaved in his own Faith, that confeſſes Chriſt, why is there ſo great a diſſenſion amongſt Religions? Why do they all condemn one another of Hereſie, and Thunder <hi>Anathema</hi>'s againſt each other? Why do the <hi>Lutherans</hi> refuſe to acknowledge the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> for their Brethren, and publickly in their Sermons and Books, avouch them to be impious and blaſphemous? Why, in the like manuer, do the Chief of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> (among whom <hi>Theodorus Beza</hi> is the Father of all, after <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>) ſo treat the <hi>Lutherans?</hi> Why do the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> call themſelves the only faithful Chriſtians, and eſteem all others as Infidels? whereby is apparent, that this new fancy of being ſaved in any Religion, is not only againſt the Catholick Doctrine, but alſo againſt all the Sects (that have any zeal for Religion or Piety) and is only too proper for Atheiſts.</p>

                  <hi>Ninth Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That one may be ſaved, it ſufficeth not to keep two or three of the Commandments, but of neceſſity he muſt obſerve all; according to that of our Lord, <hi>If thou would'ſt enter into Life, keep the Commandments,</hi> Mat. 8.9 For Example. If any one ſhould be an Adulterer, or Thief, although he ſhould keep the other Commandments, yet he cannot be ſaved (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance) as the Scriptures every where teach. So likewiſe, it ſufficeth not to Salvation, to believe three or four Articles of Faith, but of neceſſity we muſt believe all Articles which God hath revealed and propounded to our Faith by his Church. For the true Faith is no leſs neceſſary to Salvation, than Obedience to Gods Commandments; nor ought Faith to be leſs perfect and intire than Obedience and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the whole Decalogue. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Obedience ought to extend it ſelf to all the Commandments; ſo Faith ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelf to all things revealed, according to St. <hi>James, Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one, is guilty of all; for he that ſaid, thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, ſaid alſo, thou ſhalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit Adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a Tranſgreſſor of the Law,</hi> Jam. 2.10. As if he ſhould ſay, he is made guilty of all, and ſhall
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:44335:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>be puniſhed as a Tranſgreſſor or Violator of the whole <hi>Law,</hi> for deſpiſing the Law-maker, who is the Author of the whole Law. Therefore, in like manner, he that ſhall deny one Article of Faith, although he believes all the reſt, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty of the breach of his whole Faith and Religion, becauſe he contemns God, the Supream Truth, who revealed no leſs this than the others: He contemns alſo the Catholic Church,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.</note> which is the Spouſe of Chriſt, and the Pillar and Ground of Truth, and which propoſes to our Belief, as well this Article, as the reſt.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And this is the reaſon, why he is no leſs an Heretic, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately denyeth one Article of Faith, than he that denyes an hundred; becauſe (in regard of this one which he denyes) he deſpiſeth God the firſt Verity, which revealed it; and he deſpiſeth the Authority of the Church which propounds it; he makes the Church alſo ſubject to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and a Lye, whereby he makes all the reſt uncertain, and deſtroys all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith:<note place="margin">Note.</note> For if you take away the Foundation of Divine Faith, all Faith muſt neceſſarily fall to ruin and decay, and only Opinion (or human Belief, liable to Error) remain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This Opinion is very dangerous in the practice; for it makes a man not care what Religion he is of, what he believes
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:44335:118"/>or disbelieves. Therefore he ſeeks not after the Truth, and as eaſily and ſecurely receives Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood as Truth. And yet not only Catholics, but even the more noted Sects, ſuch as are more eminent for Learning and Wiſdom, hold for a certain and undoubted Truth, that without the true Faith and Religion, none can be ſaved, but will periſh everlaſtingly. Therefore the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of this Opinion are condemned by all wiſe Men, and they promiſe to themſelves Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon no Authority, no Teſtimony of Scripture, nor the ſupport of Reaſon, relying meerly upon the vain and fooliſh Imagination of their own Brains. Let them hear therefore out of St. <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> what Antiquity has ever held, and what the Church hath taught in all Ages: For ſo he writes as a general Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p>Hold this for a moſt certain and infallible Truth,<note place="margin">Lib. de fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ad Pet. 6. Diac. c. 38.</note>
